[Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/site) (W&B) is a machine learning platform for model management that includes features like experiment tracking, dataset versioning, and model performance evaluation and visualization. Using W&B with Airflow gives you a powerful ML orchestration stack with first-class features for building, training, and managing your models.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create an Airflow DAG that completes feature engineering, model training, and predictions with the Astro Python SDK and scikit-learn, and registers the model with W&B for evaluation and visualization.

## Time to complete

This tutorial takes approximately one hour to complete.

## Assumed knowledge

To get the most out of this tutorial, you should be familiar with:

- Airflow operators. See [Operators 101](what-is-an-operator.md).
- The Astro Python SDK. See [Write a DAG with the Astro Python SDK](astro-python-sdk.md)
- Weights and Biases. See [What is Weights and Biases?](https://docs.wandb.ai/?_gl=1*i7pmr7*_ga*MTI3ODk4OTUzNy4xNjc5Njc2MzE5*_ga_JH1SJHJQXJ*MTY4MTI0ODQ2OS42LjEuMTY4MTI0ODUxMS4xOC4wLjA.).

## Prerequisites

- The [Astro CLI](https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/cli/overview).
- A [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/site) account. Personal accounts are available for free.

## Quickstart  
  
If you have a Github account, you can get started quickly by cloning the demo repository. For more detailed instructions for setting up the project, start with [Step 1](#step-1-configure-your-astro-project).

1. Clone the demo repository:
      
    ```sh 
    git clone https://github.com/astronomer/airflow-wandb-demo
    cd airflow-wandb-demo
    ```
      
2. Update the .env file with your WANDB_API_KEY.

3. Start Airflow by running:

    ```sh 
    astro dev start
    ```

4. Continue with [Step 7](#step-7-run-your-dag-and-view-results) below.

## Step 1: Configure your Astro project

Use the Astro CLI to create and run an Airflow project locally.

1. Create a new Astro project:

    ```sh
    $ mkdir astro-wandb-tutorial && cd astro-wandb-tutorial
    $ astro dev init
    ```

2. Add the following line to the `requirements.txt` file of your Astro project:

    ```text
    astro-sdk-python[postgres]==1.5.3
    wandb==0.14.0
    pandas==1.5.3
    numpy==1.24.2
    scikit-learn==1.2.2
    ```

    This installs the packages needed to transform the data and run feature engineering, model training, and predictions.

## Step 2: Prepare the data

This tutorial will create a model that classifies churn risk based on customer data.

1. Create a subfolder called `data` in your Astro project `include` folder.
2. Download the demo CSV files from [this GitHub directory](https://github.com/astronomer/airflow-wandb-demo/tree/main/include/data).
3. Save the downloaded CSV files in the `include/data` folder. You should have 5 files in total.

## Step 3: Create your SQL transformation scripts

Before feature engineering and training, the data needs to be transformed. This tutorial uses the Astro Python SDK `transform_file` function to complete several transformations using SQL.

1. Create a file in your `include` folder called `customer_churn_month.sql` and copy the following code into the file.

    ```sql
    with subscription_periods as (
        select subscription_id, 
            customer_id, 
            cast(start_date as date) as start_date, 
            cast(end_date as date) as end_date, 
            monthly_amount 
            from {{subscription_periods}}
    ),

    months as (
        select cast(date_month as date) as date_month from {{util_months}}
    ),

    customers as (
        select
            customer_id,
            date_trunc('month', min(start_date)) as date_month_start,
            date_trunc('month', max(end_date)) as date_month_end
        from subscription_periods
        group by 1
    ),

    customer_months as (
        select
            customers.customer_id,
            months.date_month
        from customers
        inner join months
            on  months.date_month >= customers.date_month_start
            and months.date_month < customers.date_month_end
    ),

    joined as (
        select
            customer_months.date_month,
            customer_months.customer_id,
            coalesce(subscription_periods.monthly_amount, 0) as mrr
        from customer_months
        left join subscription_periods
            on customer_months.customer_id = subscription_periods.customer_id
            and customer_months.date_month >= subscription_periods.start_date
            and (customer_months.date_month < subscription_periods.end_date
                    or subscription_periods.end_date is null)
    ),

    customer_revenue_by_month as (
        select
            date_month,
            customer_id,
            mrr,
            mrr > 0 as is_active,
            min(case when mrr > 0 then date_month end) over (
                partition by customer_id
            ) as first_active_month,

            max(case when mrr > 0 then date_month end) over (
                partition by customer_id
            ) as last_active_month,

            case
            when min(case when mrr > 0 then date_month end) over (
                partition by customer_id
            ) = date_month then true
            else false end as is_first_month,
            case
            when max(case when mrr > 0 then date_month end) over (
                partition by customer_id
            ) = date_month then true
            else false end as is_last_month
        from joined
    ),

    joined1 as (

        select
            date_month + interval '1 month' as date_month,
            customer_id,
            0::float as mrr,
            false as is_active,
            first_active_month,
            last_active_month,
            false as is_first_month,
            false as is_last_month

        from customer_revenue_by_month

        where is_last_month

    )

    select * from joined1;
    ```

2. Create another file in your `include` folder called `customers.sql` and copy the following code into the file.

    ```sql
    with
    customers as (

        select *
        from {{customers_table}}

    ),

    orders as (

        select *
        from {{orders_table}}

    ),

    payments as (

        select *
        from {{payments_table}}

    ),

    customer_orders as (

        select
        customer_id,
        cast(min(order_date) as date) as first_order,
        cast(max(order_date) as date) as most_recent_order,
        count(order_id) as number_of_orders
        from orders

        group by customer_id

    ),

    customer_payments as (

        select
        orders.customer_id,
        sum(amount / 100) as total_amount

        from payments

        left join orders on payments.order_id = orders.order_id

        group by orders.customer_id

    ),

    final as (

        select
        customers.customer_id,
        customers.first_name,
        customers.last_name,
        customer_orders.first_order,
        customer_orders.most_recent_order,
        customer_orders.number_of_orders,
        customer_payments.total_amount as customer_lifetime_value

        from customers

        left join customer_orders on customers.customer_id = customer_orders.customer_id

        left join customer_payments on customers.customer_id = customer_payments.customer_id

    )

    select
    *
    from final
    ```

## Step 4: Create a W&B API Key

In your W&B account, create an API key that you will use to connect Airflow to W&B. You can create a key by going to the [Authorize](https://wandb.ai/authorize) page or your user settings.

## Step 5: Set up your connections and environment variables

You'll use environment variables to create Airflow connections to Snowflake and W&B, as well as to configure the Astro Python SDK.

1. Open the `.env` file in your Astro project and paste the following code.

    ```text
    WANDB_API_KEY='<your-wandb-api-key>'
    AIRFLOW_CONN_POSTGRES_DEFAULT='postgresql://postgres:postgres@host.docker.internal:5432/postgres?options=-csearch_path%3Dtmp_astro'
    ```

2. Replace `<your-wandb-api-key>` with the API key you created in [Step 4](#step-4-create-a-wb-api-key).  No changes are needed for the AIRFLOW_CONN_POSTGRES_DEFAULT environment variable.

## Step 6: Create your DAG

1. Create a file in your Astro project `dags` folder called `customer_analytics.py` and copy the following code into the file:

    <CodeBlock language="python">{weights_and_biases}</CodeBlock>

    This DAG completes the following steps:

    - The `extract_and_load` task group contains one task for each CSV in your `include/data` folder that uses the Astro Python SDK `load_file` function to load the data to Postgres.
    - The `transform` task group contains two tasks that transform the data using the Astro Python SDK `transform_file` function and the SQL scripts in your `include` folder.
    - The `features` task is a Python function implemented with the Astro Python SDK `@dataframe` decorator that uses Pandas to create the features needed for the model.
    - The `train` task is a Python function implemented with the Astro Python SDK `@dataframe` decorator that uses scikit-learn to train a Random Forest classifier model and push the results to W&B.
    - The `predict` task pulls the model from W&B in order to make predictions and stores them in postgres.

2. Run the following command to start your project in a local environment:

    ```sh
    astro dev start
    ```

## Step 7: Run your DAG and view results

1. Open the (Airflow UI)[http://localhost:8080], unpause the `customer_analytics` DAG, and trigger the DAG.

2. The logs in the `train` and `predict` tasks will contain a link to your W&B project which shows plotted results from the training and prediction. 

    ![wandb task logs](/img/guides/wandb_task_logs.png)

    Go to one of the links to view the results in W&B.
