[Databricks](https://databricks.com/) is a popular unified data and analytics platform built around fully managed Apache Spark clusters. Using the [Astro Databricks provider package](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-provider-databricks), you can create a Databricks Workflow from Databricks notebooks and run the Databricks Workflow in an Airflow DAG. This lets you use Airflow's orchestration features in combination with Databricks' cheapest compute. To get data in and out of Databricks, you can use the open-source [Astro Python SDK](https://astro-sdk-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), which greatly simplifies common ELT tasks like loading data and creating pandas DataFrames from data in your warehouse. 

This example uses a DAG to extract data from three local CSV files containing the share of solar, hydro and wind electricity in different countries over several years, run a transformation on each file, load the results to S3, and create a line chart of the aggregated data.

After the DAG runs, a graph appears in the `include` directory which shows the combined percentage of solar, hydro and wind energy in a country you selected.

## Before you start

Before you try this example, make sure you have:

- The [Astro CLI](https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/cli/overview).
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
- Access to a Databricks workspace. See [Databricks documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/getting-started/index.html) for instructions. You can use any workspace that has access to the [Databricks Workflows](https://docs.databricks.com/workflows/index.html) feature. You need a user account with permissions to create notebooks and Databricks jobs. You can use any underlying cloud service, and a [14-day free trial](https://www.databricks.com/try-databricks) is available.
- Access to an [object storage supported by the Astro Python SDK](https://astro-sdk-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/supported_file.html). This example uses an [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket.
- Access to a [relational database supported by the Astro Python SDK](https://astro-sdk-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/supported_databases.html). This example uses [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).

## Clone the project

Clone the example project from the [Astronomer GitHub](https://github.com/astronomer/learn-airflow-databricks-tutorial). 

## Edit the project

The project contains a file called `.env_example` which includes placeholder values for your credential details. After you clone the project, create a file called `.env`, copy the contents of `.env_example` into it, and delete `.env_example`. This is required because only `.env` is included in the list of files which Git will ignore when creating commits (`.gitignore`), and cloning an `.env` file directly will cause it to not be ignored the next time you push it to a GitHub repository.

In `renewable_analysis_dag.py`, replace the `DATABRICKS_LOGIN_EMAIL`, `S3_BUCKET` and `AWS_REGION` variables with your own values. Change the `COUNTRY` to analyze a different country. For available countries, refer to the source data in the `include` folder.

## Run the project

To run the example project, first make sure Docker Desktop is running. Then, open your project directory and run:

```sh
astro dev start
```

This command builds your project and spins up 4 Docker containers on your machine to run it. After the command finishes, open the Airflow UI at `https://localhost:8080/` and trigger the `renewable_analysis_dag` DAG using the play button.

## Project contents

### Data source

This example analyzes the share of solar, wind and hydro electricity for different countries. The full source data including other electricity modalities can be found in this [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/programmerrdai/renewable-energy) derived from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/renewable-energy) (License [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)).

The subset of data used in this example can be found in the `include` folder of the accompanying [GitHub repository](https://github.com/astronomer/learn-airflow-databricks-tutorial/tree/main/include).

### Project code

This project consists of one DAG, [renewable_analysis_dag](https://github.com/astronomer/learn-airflow-databricks-tutorial/blob/main/dags/renewable_analysis_dag.py), which performs an ELT process. It uses the Astro Python SDK and Astro Databricks provider to orchestrate two Databricks notebooks in a Databricks Workflow.

First, three separate CSV files, each containing the energy percentages by country for solar, hydro, and wind power respectively, are loaded into new tables in the data warehouse using the [Astro Python SDK `load file` operator](https://astro-sdk-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/astro/sql/operators/load_file.html). The operator uses [dynamic task mapping](dynamic-tasks.md) to create a mapped task instance for each dictionary in the list provided to the `.expand_kwargs` method. These tasks are then executed in parallel.

```python
in_tables = aql.LoadFileOperator.partial(
    task_id="in_tables",
).expand_kwargs(
    [
        {
            "input_file": File(path=SOLAR_CSV_PATH),
            "output_table": Table(conn_id=DB_CONN_ID, name="solar"),
        },
        {
            "input_file": File(path=HYDRO_CSV_PATH),
            "output_table": Table(conn_id=DB_CONN_ID, name="hydro"),
        },
        {
            "input_file": File(path=WIND_CSV_PATH),
            "output_table": Table(conn_id=DB_CONN_ID, name="wind"),
        },
    ]
)
```

Next, the `select_countries` task uses the Astro Python SDK [@aql.transform](https://astro-sdk-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/astro/sql/operators/transform.html) decorator to execute a SQL query on each of the three tables created in the `in_tables` task. The query selects rows only for the specified `COUNTRY` defined at the start of the DAG code and saves the results in three new tables.

The [`.map` method](dynamic-tasks.md#transform-outputs-with-map) converts the output of `select_countries` to a list of dictionaries containing the `in_table` and `output_table` parameters for each task instance using a [lambda expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#lambda). The [`.expand_kwargs` method](dynamic-tasks.md#sets-of-keyword-arguments) then dynamically maps tasks based on each pair of `in_table` and `output_table`. 

```python
@aql.transform
def select_countries(in_table, country):
    return """SELECT * FROM {{ in_table }} WHERE "Entity" = {{ country }};"""

### [...]

country_tables = select_countries.partial(country=COUNTRY).expand_kwargs(
    in_tables.output.map(
        lambda x: {
            "in_table": x,
            "output_table": Table(conn_id=DB_CONN_ID, name=f"{x.name}_country"),
        }
    )
)
```

The third task uses the Astro Python SDK [ExportToFileOperator](https://astro-sdk-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/astro/sql/operators/export.html) to export data from the three temporary tables to an object storage. 

Again, this task uses a lambda expression, `.map` and dynamic task mapping to create separate tasks and export a file for each table generated by the previously mapped tasks. This allows you to customize the number of files the DAG analyzes with only small changes to DAG code.

```python
save_files_to_S3 = aql.ExportToFileOperator.partial(
    task_id="save_files_to_S3",
    if_exists="replace",
).expand_kwargs(
    country_tables.map(
        lambda x: {
            "input_data": x,
            "output_file": File(
                path=f"s3://{S3_BUCKET}/{S3_FOLDER_COUNTRY_SUBSET}/{x.name}.csv",
                conn_id=AWS_CONN_ID,
            ),
        }
    )
)
```

Using the Astro Python SDK in the first three steps allows you to easily switch between data warehouses and object storage solutions, simply by changing the connection ID.
After these extract steps are completed, a task group created by the [Astro Databricks provider DatabricksWorkflowTaskGroup](https://astronomer.github.io/astro-provider-databricks/#databricks-workflow-taskgroup) completes the transformations:

```python
task_group = DatabricksWorkflowTaskGroup(
    group_id="databricks_workflow",
    databricks_conn_id=DATABRICKS_CONN_ID,
    job_clusters=job_cluster_spec,
)

with task_group:
    notebook_1 = DatabricksNotebookOperator(
        task_id="join_data",
        databricks_conn_id=DATABRICKS_CONN_ID,
        notebook_path=DATABRICKS_NOTEBOOK_PATH_JOIN_DATA,
        source=S3_BUCKET,
        job_cluster_key=DATABRICKS_JOB_CLUSTER_KEY,
    )
    notebook_2 = DatabricksNotebookOperator(
        task_id="transform_data",
        databricks_conn_id=DATABRICKS_CONN_ID,
        notebook_path=DATABRICKS_NOTEBOOK_PATH_TRANSFORM_DATA,
        source=S3_BUCKET,
        job_cluster_key=DATABRICKS_JOB_CLUSTER_KEY,
    )
    notebook_1 >> notebook_2
```

This task group contains three tasks: 

- `launch`: This task is automatically created by the task group and launches a job cluster with the specifications provided in the `job_cluster_spec`.
- `join_data`: This task executes the first notebook in the Databricks Workflow, which joins the data from the three CSV files created in the object storage into a single CSV file. View the full notebook code [here](https://github.com/astronomer/learn-airflow-databricks-tutorial/blob/main/databricks_notebook_code/join_data_notebook_code.py). Note that if you are using an object storage other than S3 you will need to make changes to the code enclosed in `# --------- AWS S3 specific --------- #`.
- `transform_data`: This task executes the second notebook in the Databricks Workflow, which fetches the CSV created by the `join_data` task, creates a new column `SHW%` by summing the % points for solar, hydro, and wind energy for each year, and saves the result as a CSV in the object storage. View the full notebook code [here](https://github.com/astronomer/learn-airflow-databricks-tutorial/blob/main/databricks_notebook_code/transform_data_notebook_code.py). Just like in the previous notebook, you might have to adjust this for other object storage solutions.

After the task group is completed, two tasks run in parallel.

The `delete_intake_files_S3` task uses the [S3DeleteObjectsOperator](https://registry.astronomer.io/providers/apache-airflow-providers-amazon/versions/latest/modules/S3DeleteObjectsOperator) to clean up files which are no longer needed in the S3 bucket. If you use a different object storage solution, you will need to define this task using an operator from the corresponding provider. See the [Astronomer Registry](https://registry.astronomer.io/) to explore available providers and operators.

```python
delete_intake_files_S3 = S3DeleteObjectsOperator(
    task_id="delete_intake_files_S3",
    bucket=S3_BUCKET,
    prefix=f"{S3_FOLDER_COUNTRY_SUBSET}/",
    aws_conn_id=AWS_CONN_ID,
)
```

The `create_graph` task uses the Astro Python SDK [@aql.dataframe](https://astro-sdk-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/astro/sql/operators/dataframe.html) decorator to load the information from the final CSV into a pandas DataFrame. The task creates a line plot of the % of solar, hydro, and wind energy in the specified country over time using [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), then saves the graph in the `include` folder of the project repository.

```python
@aql.dataframe
def create_graph(df: pd.DataFrame):
    sns.set_style("whitegrid")
    sns.lineplot(x="Year", y="SHW%", data=df)
    plt.title(f"% of Solar, Hydro and Wind in the {COUNTRY}")
    plt.xlabel("Year")
    plt.ylabel("Combined SHW (in %)")
    plt.savefig("include/shw.png")

# [...]

load_file_to_db = aql.load_file(
    input_file=File(path=DATABRICKS_RESULT_FILE_PATH, conn_id=AWS_CONN_ID),
    output_table=Table(conn_id=DB_CONN_ID),
)
```

Finally, the [Astro Python SDK `aql.cleanup()`](https://astro-sdk-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/astro/sql/operators/cleanup.html) task removes all temporary tables in the data warehouse that were created by Astro Python SDK tasks.
