Unless otherwise specified, new Clusters on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) are created with a set of default resources that our team has deemed appropriate for most use cases.

Read the following document for a reference of our default resources as well as supported cluster configurations.

Modifying the region of an existing Astro cluster isn't supported. If you're interested in a GCP region that isn't listed, contact [Astronomer support](https://cloud.astronomer.io/support).

## Supported Cloud SQL instance types

The following Cloud SQL instance types are supported on Astro:

- Small General Purpose (2 CPU, 8 GiB MEM)
- Medium General Purpose (4 CPU, 16 GiB MEM)
- Small Memory Optimized (2 CPU, 12 GiB MEM)
- Medium Memory Optimized (4 CPU, 24 GiB MEM)

For detailed information about each instance type, see the [Cloud SQL documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sql). If you're interested in an Cloud SQL instance type that is not on this list, contact [Astronomer support](https://cloud.astronomer.io/support).

## Supported worker node pool instance types

Each worker node in a pool runs a single worker Pod. A worker Pod's actual available size is equivalent to the total capacity of the instance type minus Astro’s system overhead.

The following table lists all available instance types for worker node pools, as well as the Pod size that is supported for each instance type. As the system requirements of Astro change, these values can increase or decrease.

| Node Instance Type | CPU     | Memory      |
| ------------------ | ------- | ----------- |
| e2-standard-4      | 3 CPUs  | 13 GiB MEM  |
