Unless otherwise specified, new clusters on Astro are created with a set of default AWS resources that should be suitable for most use cases.

Read the following document for a reference of our default resources as well as supported cluster configurations, including **AWS Region** and **Node Instance Type**.

## Default cluster values

## Supported cluster configurations

You might need to modify configurations of a new or existing cluster on Astro. This section provides a reference for cluster configuration options.

To create a new cluster on Astro with a specified configuration, see [Create a cluster](create-cluster.md). To request a change to an existing Cluster, see [Modify a cluster](modify-cluster.md). Astronomer is currently responsible for completing all cluster configuration changes.

### AWS region

Astro supports the following AWS regions:

- `af-south-1` - Africa (Cape Town)
- `ap-east-1` - Asia Pacific (Hong Kong)
- `ap-northeast-1` - Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
- `ap-northeast-2` - Asia Pacific (Seoul)
- `ap-northeast-3` - Asia Pacific (Osaka)
- `ap-southeast-1` - Asia Pacific (Singapore)
- `ap-southeast-2` - Asia Pacific (Sydney)
- `ap-south-1` - Asia Pacific (Mumbai)
- `ca-central-1` - Canada (Central)
- `eu-central-1` - Europe (Frankfurt)
- `eu-north-1` - Europe (Stockholm)
- `eu-south-1` - Europe (Milan)
- `eu-west-1` - Europe (Ireland)
- `eu-west-2` - Europe (London)
- `eu-west-3` - Europe (Paris)

- `us-west-2` - US West (Oregon)

Modifying the region of an existing cluster on Astro is not supported. If you're interested in an AWS region that is not on this list, reach out to [Astronomer support](https://support.astronomer.io).

### RDS instance type

Every Astro cluster on AWS is created with and requires an [RDS instance](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/). RDS serves as a primary relational database for the data plane and powers the metadata database of each Astro Deployment within a single cluster. During the cluster creation process, you'll be asked to specify an RDS instance type according to your use case and expected workload, but it can be modified at any time.

Astro supports a variety of AWS RDS instance types. Instance types comprise of varying combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity. For detailed information on each instance type, reference [AWS documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/instance-types/). If you're interested in an RDS instance type that is not on this list, reach out to [Astronomer support](https://support.astronomer.io).

### Worker node pools

A node pool is a group of nodes within a cluster that all have the same configuration. On Astro, worker nodes are responsible for running the Pods that execute Airflow tasks. Each worker node pool can be configured with a node instance type and a maximum node count. All Astro clusters have one worker node pool by default, but you can configure additional node pools for advanced configurability.

If your cluster has multiple worker node pools with different worker node instance types, users in your organization can configure tasks to run on those worker types using [worker queues](configure-deployment-resources.md#worker-queues). To enable a new worker type for your cluster, contact [Astronomer support](https://support.astronomer.io) with a request to create a new node pool or modify an existing node pool.

Astronomer monitors your usage and the number of nodes deployed in your cluster. As your usage of Airflow increases, Astronomer support might contact you and provide recommendations for updating your node pools to optimize your infrastructure spend or increase the efficiency of your tasks.

For information about each instance type, see [Amazon EC2 Instance Types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/).

### Worker node types

Each worker in a worker node pool runs a single worker Pod. A worker Pod's actual available size is equivalent to the total capacity of the instance type minus Astro’s system overhead.

The following table lists all available instance types for worker node pools, as well as the Pod size that is supported for each instance type. As the system requirements of Astro change, these values can increase or decrease.

:::info

With the exception of `m5d` nodes, all supported node types have a maximum of 20GB of storage per node for system use only. If you need locally attached storage for task execution, Astronomer recommends modifying your cluster to run `m5d` nodes, which Astronomer provisions with NVMe SSD volumes.

The ability to provision ephemeral storage for all node instance types is coming soon.

If you need to pass significant data between Airflow tasks, Astronomer recommends using an [XCom backend](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/xcoms.html) such as [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) or [Google Cloud Storage (GCS)](https://cloud.google.com/storage). For more information and best practices, see the Airflow Guide on [Passing Data Between Airflow Tasks](https://www.astronomer.io/guides/airflow-passing-data-between-tasks).

### Maximum node count

Each Astro cluster has a limit on how many nodes it can run at once. This maximum includes worker nodes as well as system nodes managed by Astronomer.

The default maximum node count for all nodes across your cluster is 20. A cluster's node count is most affected by the number of worker Pods that are executing Airflow tasks. See [Worker autoscaling logic](configure-deployment-resources.md#worker-autoscaling-logic).

If the node count for your cluster reaches the maximum node count, new tasks might not run or get scheduled. Astronomer monitors maximum node count and is responsible for contacting your organization if it is reached. To check your cluster's current node count, contact [Astronomer Support](https://support.astronomer.io).
