Using the Astro CLI to push your Astro project, including your DAG code, to a Deployment is the foundation for managing changes on Astro. Astro supports two deployment methods:

- Image-only deploys, where all files in your Astro project are built into a single Docker image and pushed to Astro in a single step.
- [DAG-only deploys](deploy-code.md#DAG-only-deploys), where the DAGs in your Astro project are deployed separately from the Docker image that is built for all other project files.

Follow the steps in this document to manually push your Astro project to a Deployment. For production environments, Astronomer recommends automating all code deploys with CI/CD. See [CI/CD](ci-cd.md).

## Prerequisites

- The [Astro CLI](cli/overview.md) installed in an empty directory.
- An Astro Workspace with at least one [Deployment](create-deployment.md).
- An [Astro project](create-project.md).
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

## Image-only deploys

With an image-only deploy, all files in your Astro project are built into a single Docker image and pushed to Astro in a single step.

### Step 1: Authenticate to Astro

Run the following command to authenticate to Astro:

```sh
astro login
```

After running this command, you are prompted to open your web browser and log in to the Cloud UI. Once you complete this login, you are automatically authenticated to the CLI.

:::tip

If you have [Deployment API key](api-keys.md) credentials set as OS-level environment variables on your local machine, you can deploy directly to Astro without needing to manually authenticate. This setup is required for automating code deploys with [CI/CD](ci-cd.md).

:::

### Step 2: Push your Astro project to an Astro Deployment

To deploy your Astro project, run:

```sh
astro deploy
```

This command returns a list of Deployments available in your Workspace and prompts you to pick one.

After you select a Deployment, the CLI parses your DAGs to ensure that they don't contain basic syntax and import errors. This test is equivalent to the one that runs during `astro dev parse` in a local Airflow environment. If any of your DAGs fail this parse, the deploy to Astro also fails.

If your code passes the parse, the Astro CLI builds your Astro project directory into a new Docker image and then pushes the image to your Deployment on Astro. To force a deploy even if your project has DAG errors, you can run `astro deploy --force`.

:::tip

To validate your code before deploying it to Astro, you can run `astro deploy --pytest`. Adding the `--pytest` flag makes the CLI run all tests in your project's `tests` directory using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.0.x/contents.html). If any of these tests fail, your code deploy also fails. This can help you prevent your team from deploying DAGs to Astro that contain errors.

For more information about using Pytest, see [Test and troubleshoot locally](test-and-troubleshoot-locally.md#test-dags-locally-with-pytest).

:::

### Step 3: Validate your changes

After the deploy completes, Docker image information for your Deployment is available in the **Image tag** field in the footer of the Airflow UI. Depending on how your organization deploys to Astro, the **Image tag** field displays a unique identifier generated by a Continuous Integration (CI) tool or a timestamp generated by the Astro CLI on `astro deploy`. The **Image tag** field in the Airflow UI footer identifies the Docker image running on the webserver of your Deployment. This information can help you determine if your deploy was successful, but it does not identify the Docker image running on your scheduler, triggerer, or workers. To confirm a code push with complete certainty, contact [Astronomer support](https://cloud.astronomer.io/support).

1. In the Cloud UI, select a Workspace and then select the Deployment you pushed code to.
2. Click **Open Airflow**.
3. Scroll to the bottom of the page and view the **Image tag** information in the footer:

### What happens during an image-only deploy

When you deploy code to Astro and the DAG-only deploy feature is not enabled, your Astro project is built into a Docker image. This includes system-level dependencies, Python-level dependencies, DAGs, and your `Dockerfile`. It does not include any of the metadata associated with your local Airflow environment, including task history and Airflow connections or variables that were set locally. This Docker image is then pushed to all containers running Apache Airflow on Astro.

![Deploy code](/img/docs/deploy-architecture.png)

With the exception of the Airflow webserver and some Celery workers, Kubernetes gracefully terminates all containers during this process. This forces them to restart and begin running your latest code.

If you deploy code to a Deployment that is running a previous version of your code, then the following happens:

- Tasks that are `running` will continue to execute on existing Celery workers and will not be interrupted unless the task does not complete within 24 hours of the code deploy.
- One or more new worker(s) will be created alongside your existing workers and immediately start executing scheduled tasks based on your latest code.

    These new workers will execute downstream tasks of DAG runs that are in progress. For example, if you deploy to Astronomer when `Task A` of your DAG is running, `Task A` will continue to run on an old Celery worker. If `Task B` and `Task C` are downstream of `Task A`, they will both be scheduled on new Celery workers running your latest code.

    This means that DAG runs could fail due to downstream tasks running code from a different source than their upstream tasks. DAG runs that fail this way need to be fully restarted from the Airflow UI so that all tasks are executed based on the same source code.

Astronomer sets a grace period of 24 hours for all workers to allow running tasks to continue executing. This grace period is not configurable. If a task does not complete within 24 hours, its worker will be terminated. Airflow will mark the task as a [zombie](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/tasks.html#zombie-undead-tasks) and it will retry according to the task's retry policy. This is to ensure that our team can reliably upgrade and maintain Astro as a service.

:::tip

If you want to force long-running tasks to terminate sooner than 24 hours, specify an [`execution_timeout`](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/tasks.html#timeouts) in your DAG's task definition.

## DAG-only deploys

:::caution

This feature is in Public Preview. It is still in development and features and functionality are subject to change.

:::

There are some scenarios where you might want to deploy only the `dags` directory of your Astro project. To do this, you can enable the DAG-only deploy feature per Deployment.

Enabling DAG-only deploys on Astro has a few benefits:

- DAG-based deploys are significantly faster than image-only deploys when you deploy only changes to your DAGs. Your updated code will appear in the Airflow UI much faster.
- When you push only changes to your DAGs, the workers and schedulers in your Deployment will pick up your changes gracefully and will not restart. This results in improved reliability, a more efficient use of running workers, and no downtime for your Deployment.
- You can have different sets of users deploy project changes versus DAG changes. See [DAG-based workflows](ci-cd.md#dag-based-workflows) for how you can set this up in your CI/CD pipelines.

### Enable DAG-only deploys

When the DAG-only deploy feature is enabled, DAGs are deployed separately and are never built into or included in the Docker image for your Astro project. You must still run `astro deploy` when you make a change to any file in your Astro project that is not in the `dags` directory. All files in your Astro project that are not in the `dags` directory are built into a Docker image and pushed to Astro.

To push DAG-only changes to Astro, you must enable the feature for each Deployment. Enabling DAG-only deploys requires Astro CLI version 1.7 or above. See [Install the Astro CLI](cli/install-cli.md).

1. Run:

    ```sh
    astro deployment update --dag-deploy enable
    ```

2. When the prompt appears in the Astro CLI, select a Deployment where you want to enable the feature. Running tasks will not be interrupted and new tasks will continue to be scheduled.

### Trigger a DAG-only deploy

Triggering a DAG-only deploy pushes DAGs to Astro and mounts them to the workers and schedulers in your Deployment. DAG-only deploys do not disrupt running tasks and do not cause any components to restart when you push code. If you deploy changes to a DAG that is currently running, active task runs finish executing according to the code from before you triggered a deploy. New task runs are scheduled using the code from your latest deploy.

Run the following command to deploy only your `dags` directory to a Deployment:

```sh
astro deploy --dags
```
