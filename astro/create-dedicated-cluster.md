A _dedicated cluster_ exclusively runs Deployments from your Organization within a single-tenant environment on Astronomer's cloud. Dedicated clusters provide more configuration options for regions, connectivity, and security than standard clusters. You might want to create a dedicated cluster if:

- You need to connect Astronomer's cloud to an external cloud using VPC peering. Standard clusters are compatible with all other supported connection types.
- You want more options for the region your cluster is hosted in. 
- You otherwise want to keep your Deployments as isolated as possible. 

Dedicated clusters offer the self-service convenience of a fully managed service while respecting the need to keep data private, secure, and within a single-tenant environment. If you don't need the aforementioned features, you can use one of the standard clusters when you [Create a Deployment](create-deployment.md).
