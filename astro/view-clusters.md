## View clusters

The following information is provided at the top of the **Clusters** page for quick access:

The **Workspace Authorization** tab lets you define what Workspaces can create Deployments on the cluster.

The **Tags** tab displays custom tags for the AWS clusters created by Astronomer support. When the clusters are created, you can request custom tags to quickly identify and categorize your clusters by purpose, owner, or other business need.
