:::caution

This document applies only to [Astro Hybrid](hybrid-overview.md). To see whether you're an Astro Hybrid user, click the Astronomer logo in the upper left corner of the Cloud UI and go to **Settings** > **General**. Your Astro product type is listed under **Product Type**.

To create a Deployment on Astro Hosted, see [Astro resource reference](resource-reference-hosted.md).

:::

Unless otherwise specified, new clusters on Astro are created with a set of default Azure resources that should be suitable for most use cases.

Read the following document for a reference of our default resources as well as supported cluster configurations.

## Supported cluster regions

You can host Astro Hybrid clusters in the following Azure regions:

| Code               | Name               | 
| ------------------ | ------------------ | 
| `australiaeast`    | Australia East     |

Modifying the region of an existing Astro cluster isn't supported. If you're interested in a region that isn't listed, contact [Astronomer support](https://cloud.astronomer.io/support).

¹ If you want to host Astro in a dedicated account owned by your Organization in one of these regions, you'll need to contact [Microsoft Azure Support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/contact-microsoft-azure-support-2315e669-8b1f-493b-5fb1-d88a8736ffe4) to enable the regions. If you require clarification about this requirement, contact [Astronomer support](https://cloud.astronomer.io/support). 

## Supported Azure Database for PostgreSQL instance types

The following Azure Database for PostgreSQL instance types are supported on Astro: 

- Standard_D2ds_v4 (2 CPU, 8 GiB MEM)
- Standard_D4ds_v4 (4 CPU, 16 GiB MEM)
- Standard_E2ds_v4 (2 CPU, 16 GiB MEM)
- Standard_E4ds_v4 (4 CPU, 32 GiB MEM)

For detailed information about each instance type, see the [Azure Database for PostgreSQL documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/). If you're interested in an Azure Database for PostgreSQL instance type that is not on this list, contact [Astronomer support](https://cloud.astronomer.io/support).

## Supported worker node pool instance types

<!-- For new node instance types, subtract 2 CPU and 1.5 GiB RAM from the listed  figures in the cloud provider's reference page-->

Each worker node in a pool runs a single worker Pod. A worker Pod's actual available size is equivalent to the total capacity of the instance type minus Astro’s system overhead.

The following table lists all available instance types for worker node pools, as well as the Pod size that is supported for each instance type. As the system requirements of Astro change, these values can increase or decrease.

| Node Instance Type | CPU      | Memory      |
| ------------------ | -------- | ----------- |
| Standard_D4_v5     | 2.5 CPUs | 9.3 GiB MEM |
| Standard_D8_v5     | 6.4 CPUs | 24 GiB MEM  |
| Standard_D4d_v5    | 2.5 CPUs | 9.3 GiB MEM |
| Standard_D8d_v5    | 6.4 CPUs | 24 GiB MEM  |
| Standard_B4ms      | 2.5 CPUs | 9.3 GiB MEM |
| Standard_B8ms      | 6.4 CPUs | 24 GiB MEM  |
