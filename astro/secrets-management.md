## Overview

As the modern data orchestration service, Astronomer Cloud has been built and deployed with security as a guiding architectural principle. This same principle extends into how your sensitive information used to access your data is stored and secured. Astronomer Cloud offers a managed secrets backend for encryption and storage of [secret environment variables](environment-variables.md#set-environment-variables-via-the-astronomer-ui), as well as [integration with popular secrets management](secrets-backend.md) tools.

All secrets management configuration performed in the Astronomer UI is [securely transmitted and stored](data-protection.md), is [resilient](resilience.md) to in-region cloud failures, and can be [recovered](disaster-recovery.md) in the case of a full Control and/or Data Plane disaster.
