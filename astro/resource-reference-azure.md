Modifying the region of an existing Astro cluster isn't supported. If you're interested in a region that isn't listed, contact [Astronomer support](https://cloud.astronomer.io/support).

¹ If you want to host Astro in a dedicated account owned by your Organization (Bring Your Own Cloud) in one of these regions, you'll need to contact [Microsoft Azure Support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/contact-microsoft-azure-support-2315e669-8b1f-493b-5fb1-d88a8736ffe4) to enable the regions. If you require clarification about this requirement, contact [Astronomer support](https://cloud.astronomer.io/support). 

## Supported Azure Database for PostgreSQL instance types

The following Azure Database for PostgreSQL instance types are supported on Astro: 

- Standard_D2ds_v4 (2 CPU, 8 GiB MEM)
- Standard_D4ds_v4 (4 CPU, 16 GiB MEM)
- Standard_E2ds_v4 (2 CPU, 16 GiB MEM)
- Standard_E4ds_v4 (4 CPU, 32 GiB MEM)

For detailed information about each instance type, see the [Azure Database for PostgreSQL documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/). If you're interested in an Azure Database for PostgreSQL instance type that is not on this list, contact [Astronomer support](https://cloud.astronomer.io/support).

## Supported worker node pool instance types

Each worker node in a pool runs a single worker Pod. A worker Pod's actual available size is equivalent to the total capacity of the instance type minus Astro’s system overhead.

The following table lists all available instance types for worker node pools, as well as the Pod size that is supported for each instance type. As the system requirements of Astro change, these values can increase or decrease.

| Node Instance Type | CPU      | Memory      |
| ------------------ | -------- | ----------- |
| Standard_D4_v5     | 2.5 CPUs | 9.3 GiB MEM |
| Standard_D8_v5     | 6.4 CPUs | 24 GiB MEM  |
| Standard_D4d_v5    | 2.5 CPUs | 9.3 GiB MEM |
| Standard_D8d_v5    | 6.4 CPUs | 24 GiB MEM  |
| Standard_B4ms      | 2.5 CPUs | 9.3 GiB MEM |
| Standard_B8ms      | 6.4 CPUs | 24 GiB MEM  |

If your Organization needs an instance type that supports a larger worker size, contact [Astronomer support](https://support.astronomer.io). For more information about configuring worker size on Astro, see [Configure a Deployment](configure-deployment-resources.md).
