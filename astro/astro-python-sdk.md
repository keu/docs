The Astro Python SDK is an open source tool for DAG development that is built and maintained by Astronomer. The purpose of the SDK is to remove the complexity associated with writing DAGs and setting Airflow configurations. This enables pipeline authors to focus on writing Python code.

The Astro SDK uses Python [decorators](https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/) and the TaskFlow API to simplify Python functions for common data orchestration use cases. Specifically, the Astro SDK decorators include eight python functions that make it easier to:

- Extract a file from a remote object store, such as Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage (GCS).
- Load that file to a new or existing table in a data warehouse, such as Snowflake.
- Transform the data in that file with SQL written by your team.

For extract, load, and transform (ELT) use cases, these functions significantly reduce the lines of code required. The Astro SDK is more similar to writing a traditional Python script than it is writing a data pipeline in Airflow.

## Installation

1. Install the Astro Python SDK package by adding the following line to the `requirements.txt` file of your Astro project:

    ```text
    astro-sdk-python
    ```

2. Add the following environment variables to the `.env` file of your Astro project:

    ```text
    AIRFLOW__CORE__ENABLE_XCOM_PICKLING=True
    export AIRFLOW__ASTRO_SDK__SQL_SCHEMA=<default-schema>
    ```

    To deploy a pipeline written with the Astro Python SDK to Astro, add these environment variables in your Deployment configuration. See [Environment variables](environment-variables.md).

## Available functions

The Astro SDK includes task decorators for actions that are most commonly required for ETL pipelines:

- `load_file`: Loads a given file into a SQL table.
- `transform`: Applies a SQL select statement to a source table and saves the result to a destination table.
- `drop_table`: Drops a SQL table.
- `run_raw_sql`: Runs any SQL statement without handling its output.
- `append`: Inserts rows from the source SQL table into the destination SQL table, if there are no conflicts.
- `merge`: Inserts rows from the source SQL table into the destination SQL table, depending on conflicts:
- `export_file`: Exports SQL table rows into a destination file.
- `dataframe`: Exports a specific SQL table into an in-memory pandas DataFrame.
- `cleanup`: Cleans up temporary tables created in your pipeline.

## Example

The following DAG is a complete implementation of an ETL pipeline using the Astro Python SDK. In order, the DAG:

- Loads `.csv` files from GitHub into `Tables`, which are objects that contain all of the necessary functionality to pass database contexts between functions without reconfiguration.
- Combines the two `Tables` of home data using `aql.transform`.
- Turns the temporary `Table` into a dataframe, melts the values using `aql.dataframe`, and returns the results as a `Table`.
- Creates a new reporting table in Snowflake using `aql.run_raw_sql`.
- Appends the `Table` of transformed home data to a reporting table with `aql.append`.

This Astro SDK implementation is different from a standard TaskFlow implementation in the following ways:

- You don't have to manually create temp tables and pass them through XComs. All operations between different database types are handled automatically by the SDK.
- You don't have to define connections to your databases in each task. Tasks can automatically inherit connection information from `Tables`.
- You can run common SQL queries using Python alone. The SDK includes Python functions for some of the most common actions in SQL.
