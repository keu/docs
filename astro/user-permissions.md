To better protect your data pipelines and cloud infrastructure, Astro provides role based access control for Organizations and Workspaces. Each Astro user has a Workspace role in each Workspace they belong to, plus a single Organization role. Role based access control is not available for Deployments.

Astro has hierarchical role based access control. Within a given Workspace or Organization, users with senior roles have their own permissions in addition to the permissions granted to lower roles. For example, users with Organization Owner permissions inherit Organization Billing Admin and Organization Member permissions because the roles are lower in the hierarchy. 

The Astro role hierarchies in order of inheritance are: 

- Organization Owner > Organization Billing Admin > Organization Member 
- Workspace Admin > Workspace Editor > Workspace Member

Users with Organization Owner permissions also inherit Workspace Admin permissions on all Workspaces.

## Organization roles

An Organization role grants a user some level of access to an Astro Organization, including all of the Workspaces within that Organization. All users have an Organization role regardless of whether they belong to a Workspace. The following table lists the available Organization roles:

### Update Organization roles

1. In the Cloud UI, go to **Settings** > **Access Management**.
2. Find the user in the table and click **Edit**. The **Members** table lists all users that have been added to a Workspace in your Organization. If you can't find a user, it might be because they haven't been invited to a Workspace or accepted their invite.
