---

To better protect your data pipelines and cloud infrastructure, Astro provides role based access control (RBAC) for Organizations and Workspaces. Each Astro user has a Workspace role in each Workspace they belong to, plus a single Organization role. Role based access control is not available for Deployments.

You can also apply roles to API tokens to limit the scope of their actions in CI/CD and automation pipelines. See [Manage Deployments as code](manage-deployments-as-code.md).

Astro has hierarchical RBAC. Within a given Workspace or Organization, senior roles have their own permissions in addition to the permissions granted to lower roles. For example, a user or API token with Organization Owner permissions inherits Organization Billing Admin and Organization Member permissions because those roles are lower in the hierarchy. 

The Astro role hierarchies in order of inheritance are: 

- Organization Owner > Organization Billing Admin > Organization Member 
- Workspace Admin > Workspace Editor > Workspace Member

Additionally, Organization Owners inherit Workspace Admin permissions for all Workspaces in the Organization.


## Organization roles

An Organization role grants a user or API token some level of access to an Astro Organization, including all of the Workspaces within that Organization. All users have an Organization role regardless of whether they belong to a Workspace whereas an API token's access is based on it's scope. The following table lists the available Organization roles:

| Permission                                                       | **Organization Member** | **Organization Billing Admin** | **Organization Owner** |

## Workspace roles

A Workspace role grants a user or API token some level of access to a specific Workspace. All Deployments in a Workspace will be accessible to the user or API token based on it's Workspace role. The following table lists the available Workspace roles:

| Permission                                          | **Workspace Member** | **Workspace Editor** | **Workspace Admin** |
