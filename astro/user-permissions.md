## Overview

This document provides information about all available user roles in Astro.

To better protect your data pipelines and cloud infrastructure, Astro offers role-based access control for Organizations and Workspaces. Each Astro user has a Workspace role in each Workspace they belong to, plus a single Organization role.

## Organization Roles

An Organization role grants a user some level of access to an Astro Organization, including all of the Workspaces within that Organization. All users have an Organization role regardless of whether they belong to a Workspace. The following Organization roles are available:

| Permission                                           | **Organization Member** | **Organization Billing Admin** | **Organization Owner** |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------- |

| Workspace Admin permissions to all Workspaces        |                         |                                | ✔️                     |

:::info Default Roles in New Organizations

The first 3 users that log in to a new Organization will automatically become Organization Owners. Any new users after that will automatically become Organization Members.

### Update Organization Roles

:::info

Currently, you cannot invite users directly to an Organization. To add a user to an Organization, add them through a Workspace invite as described in [Add User](add-user.md). Organization invites are coming soon.

:::

To update a user's Organization role:

1. In the Cloud UI, go to the **People** tab. This tab is available in the Organization view of the UI.
2. Find the user in the table and click the **Edit** button next to their entry. The **Members** table contains a list of all users that have been added to at least one Workspace in your Organization. If you can't find a user in this table, it might be because they haven't yet been invited to a Workspace or accepted their invite.

## Workspace Roles

A Workspace role grants a user some level of access to a specific Workspace. The following Workspace roles are available:

| Permission                           | **Workspace Viewer** | **Workspace Editor** | **Workspace Admin** |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| View Workspace users                 | ✔️                   | ✔️                   | ✔️                  |
| View all Deployments in the Cloud UI | ✔️                   | ✔️                   | ✔️                  |
| View DAGs in the Airflow UI          | ✔️                   | ✔️                   | ✔️                  |
| Push code to Deployments             |                      | ✔️                   | ✔️                  |
| Update Deployment settings           |                      | ✔️                   | ✔️                  |
| Update user roles and information    |                      |                      | ✔️                  |
