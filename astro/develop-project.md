An Astro project contains all of the files necessary to test and run DAGs in a local Airflow environment and on Astro. This guide provides information about adding and organizing Astro project files, including:

- Adding DAGs
- Adding Python and OS-level packages
- Setting environment variables
- Applying changes
- Running on-build commands

For information about testing DAGs after you’ve added them to your Astro project, see [Test and troubleshoot locally](test-and-troubleshoot-locally.md).

:::tip

As you add to your Astro project, Astronomer recommends reviewing the [Astronomer Registry](https://registry.astronomer.io/), a library of Airflow modules, providers, and DAGs that serve as the building blocks for data pipelines.

The Astronomer Registry includes:

- Example DAGs for many data sources and destinations. For example, you can create a data quality use case with Snowflake and Great Expectations using the [Great Expectations Snowflake Example DAG](https://legacy.registry.astronomer.io/dags/great-expectations-snowflake).
- Documentation for Airflow providers, such as [Databricks](https://registry.astronomer.io/providers/databricks), [Snowflake](https://registry.astronomer.io/providers/snowflake), and [Postgres](https://registry.astronomer.io/providers/postgres). This documentation is comprehensive and based on Airflow source code.
- Documentation for Airflow modules, such as the [PythonOperator](https://registry.astronomer.io/providers/apache-airflow/modules/pythonoperator), [BashOperator](https://registry.astronomer.io/providers/apache-airflow/modules/bashoperator), and [S3ToRedshiftOperator](https://registry.astronomer.io/providers/amazon/modules/s3toredshiftoperator). These modules provide guidance on setting Airflow connections and their parameters.

:::

## Prerequisites

- The [Astro CLI](cli/overview.md)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

## Create an Astro project

To create a new Astro project, run the following command in an empty directory:

```sh
astro dev init
```

This command generates the following files in the directory:

```text
.
├── .env # Local environment variables
├── dags # Where your DAGs go
│   ├── example-dag-basic.py # Example DAG that showcases a simple ETL data pipeline
│   └── example-dag-advanced.py # Example DAG that showcases more advanced Airflow features, such as the TaskFlow API
├── Dockerfile # For the Astro Runtime Docker image, environment variables, and overrides
├── include # For any other files you'd like to include
├── plugins # For any custom or community Airflow plugins
│   └── example-plugin.py
├── tests # For any DAG unit test files to be run with pytest
│   └── test_dag_integrity.py # Test that checks for basic errors in your DAGs
├── airflow_settings.yaml # For your Airflow connections, variables and pools (local only)
├── packages.txt # For OS-level packages
└── requirements.txt # For Python packages
```

Use the rest of this document to learn more about modifying each of these folders and files.

## Build and run a project locally

Applying changes to your Astro project and testing them locally requires an Airflow environment on your computer. To start an Astro project in a local Airflow environment, run the following command:

```sh
astro dev start
```

The command builds your Astro project into a Docker image and creates the following Docker containers:

- **Postgres:** The Airflow metadata database
- **Webserver:** The Airflow component responsible for rendering the Airflow UI
- **Scheduler:** The Airflow component responsible for monitoring and triggering tasks
- **Triggerer:** The Airflow component responsible for running triggers and signaling tasks to resume when their conditions have been met. The triggerer is used exclusively for tasks that are run with [deferrable operators](https://docs.astronomer.io/learn/deferrable-operators).

After the project builds, you can access the Airflow UI at `http://localhost:8080/`. You can also access your Postgres database at `localhost:5432/postgres`. As long as your Airflow environment is running, any changes you make in your `dags`, `plugins`, and `include` directories are automatically applied without needing to restart the environment. 

### Restart your local environment

You must restart your environment to apply changes from any of the following files in your Astro project:

- `packages.txt`
- `Dockerfile`
- `requirements.txt`
- `airflow_settings.yaml`

To restart your local Airflow environment, run:

```sh
astro dev restart
```

This command rebuilds your image and restarts the Docker containers running on your local machine with the new image. Alternatively, you can run `astro dev stop` to stop your Docker containers without restarting your environment, then run `astro dev start` when you want to restart.

## Add DAGs

In Apache Airflow, data pipelines are defined in Python code as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). A DAG is a collection of tasks and dependencies between tasks that are defined as code. See [Introduction to Airflow DAGs](https://docs.astronomer.io/learn/dags).

DAGs are stored in the `dags` folder of your Astro project. To add a DAG to your project:

1. Add the `.py` file to the `dags` folder.
2. Save your changes. If you're using a Mac, use **Command-S**.
3. Refresh your Airflow browser.

:::tip

Use the `astro run <dag-id>` command to run and debug a DAG from the command line without starting a local Airflow environment. This is an alternative to testing your entire Astro project with the Airflow webserver and scheduler. See [Run and Debug DAGs with Astro Run](test-and-troubleshoot-locally.md#run-and-debug-dags-with-astro-run).

:::

## Add utility files

Airflow DAGs sometimes require utility files to run workflows. This can include:
 
- SQL files.
- Custom Airflow operators.
- Python functions.
 
When more than one DAG in your Astro project needs a certain function or query, creating a shared utility file helps make your DAGs idempotent, more readable, and minimizes the amount of code you have in each DAG.

You can store utility files in the `/dags` directory of your Astro project. In most cases, Astronomer recommends adding your utility files to the `/dags` directory and organizing them into sub-directories based on whether they're needed for a single DAG or for multiple DAGs.

In the following example, the `dags` folder includes both types of utility files:

```text
└── dags
    ├── my_dag
    │   ├── my_dag.py
    │   └── my_dag_utils.py  # specific DAG utils
    └── utils
        └── common_utils.py # common utils
```

1. To add utility files which are shared between all your DAGs, create a folder named `utils` in the `dags` directory of your Astro project. To add utility files only for a specific DAG, create a new folder in `dags` to store both your DAG file and your utility file. 
2. Add your utility files to the folder you created.
3. Reference your utility files in your DAG code.
4. Apply your changes. If you're developing locally, refresh the Airflow UI in your browser.

Utility files in the `/dags` directory will not be parsed by Airflow, so you don't need to specify them in `.airflowignore` to prevent parsing. If you're using [DAG-only deploys](https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/deploy-code#deploy-dags-only) on Astro, changes to this folder are deployed when you run `astro deploy --dags` and do not require rebuilding your Astro project into a Docker image and restarting your Deployment. 

## Add Airflow connections, pools, variables

Airflow connections connect external applications such as databases and third-party services to Apache Airflow. See [Manage connections in Apache Airflow](https://docs.astronomer.io/learn/connections#airflow-connection-basics) or [Apache Airflow documentation](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/connection.html).

To add Airflow [connections](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/connection.html), [pools](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/administration-and-deployment/pools.html), and [variables](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/variable.html) to your local Airflow environment, you have the following options:

- Use the Airflow UI. In **Admin**, click **Connections**, **Variables** or **Pools**, and then add your values. These values are stored in the metadata database and are deleted when you run the [`astro dev kill` command](cli/astro-dev-kill.md), which can sometimes be used for troubleshooting.
- Modify the `airflow_settings.yaml` file of your Astro project. This file is included in every Astro project and permanently stores your values in plain-text. To prevent you from committing sensitive credentials or passwords to your version control tool, Astronomer recommends adding this file to `.gitignore`.
- Use a secret backend, such as AWS Secrets Manager, and access the secret backend locally. See [Configure an external secrets backend on Astro](secrets-backend.md).

When you add Airflow objects to the Airflow UI of a local environment or to your `airflow_settings.yaml` file, your values can only be used locally. When you deploy your project to a Deployment on Astro, the values in this file are not included.

Astronomer recommends using the `airflow_settings.yaml` file so that you don’t have to manually redefine these values in the Airflow UI every time you restart your project. To ensure the security of your data, Astronomer recommends [configuring a secrets backend](secrets-backend.md).

## Add test data or files for local testing

Use the `include` folder of your Astro project to store files for testing locally, such as test data or a dbt project file. The files in your `include` folder are included in your deploys to Astro, but they are not parsed by Airflow. Therefore, you don't need to specify them in `.airflowignore` to prevent parsing. 

If you're running Airflow locally, apply your changes by refreshing the Airflow UI.

### Configure `airflow_settings.yaml` (Local development only)

The `airflow_settings.yaml` file includes a template with the default values for all possible configurations. To add a connection, variable, or pool, replace the default value with your own.

1. Open the `airflow_settings.yaml` file and replace the default value with your own.

    ```yaml

    airflow:
      connections: ## conn_id and conn_type are required
        - conn_id: my_new_connection
          conn_type: postgres
          conn_host: 123.0.0.4
          conn_schema: airflow
          conn_login: user
          conn_password: pw
          conn_port: 5432
          conn_extra:
      pools: ## pool_name and pool_slot are required
        - pool_name: my_new_pool
          pool_slot: 5
          pool_description:
      variables: ## variable_name and variable_value are required
        - variable_name: my_variable
          variable_value: my_value
    
    ```

2. Save the modified `airflow_settings.yaml` file in your code editor. If you use a Mac computer, for example, use **Command-S**.
3. Import these objects to the Airflow UI. Run:

    ```sh
    astro dev object import
    ```

4. In the Airflow UI, click **Connections**, **Pools**, or **Variables** to see your new or modified objects.
5. Optional. To add another connection, pool, or variable, you append it to this file within its corresponding section. To create another variable, add it under the existing `variables` section of the same file. For example:

  ```yaml
  
  variables:
    - variable_name: <my-variable-1>
      variable_value: <my-variable-value>
    - variable_name: <my-variable-2>
      variable_value: <my-variable-value-2>
  
  ```

## Add Python, OS-level packages, and Airflow providers

Most DAGs need additional OS or Python packages to run. There are two primary kinds of Python packages that you might have to add to your Astro project:

- Python libraries. If you’re using Airflow for a data science project, for example, you might use a data science library such as [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) or [NumPy (`numpy`)](https://numpy.org/).
- Airflow providers. Airflow providers are Python packages that contain all relevant Airflow modules for a third-party service. For example, `apache-airflow-providers-amazon` includes the hooks, operators, and integrations you need to access services on Amazon Web Services (AWS) with Airflow. See [Provider packages](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers/).

Adding the name of a package to the `packages.txt` or `requirements.txt` files of your Astro project installs the package to your Airflow environment or Deployment. Python packages are installed from your `requirements.txt` file using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).

1. Add the package name to your Astro project. If it’s a Python package, add it to `requirements.txt`. If it’s an OS-level package, add it to `packages.txt`. The latest version of the package that’s publicly available is installed by default.

    To pin a version of a package, use the following syntax:

      ```text
      <package-name>==<version>
      ```
    For example, to install NumPy version 1.23.0, add the following to your `requirements.txt` file:

      ```text
      numpy==1.23.0
      ```
2. [Restart your local environment](develop-project.md#restart-your-local-environment).
3. Confirm that your package was installed:

    ```sh
    astro dev bash --scheduler "pip freeze | grep <package-name>"
    ```

To learn more about the format of the `requirements.txt` file, see [Requirements File Format](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format/#requirements-file-format) in pip documentation. To browse Python libraries, see [PyPi](https://pypi.org/). To browse Airflow providers, see the [Astronomer Registry](https://registry.astronomer.io/providers/).

## Set environment variables locally

For local development, Astronomer recommends setting environment variables in your Astro project’s `.env` file. You can then push your environment variables from the `.env` file to a Deployment on Astro. To manage environment variables in the Cloud UI, see [Environment variables](environment-variables.md).

If your environment variables contain sensitive information or credentials that you don’t want to expose in plain-text, you can add your `.env` file to `.gitignore` when you deploy these changes to your version control tool.

1. Open the `.env` file in your Astro project directory.
2. Add your environment variables to the `.env` file or run `astro deployment variable list --save` to copy environment variables from an existing Deployment to the file.

    Use the following format when you set environment variables in your `.env` file:

    ```text
    KEY=VALUE
    ```

    Environment variables should be in all-caps and not include spaces.

3. [Restart your local environment](develop-project.md#restart-your-local-environment).
4. Run the following command to confirm that your environment variables were applied locally:
   
    ```sh
    astro dev bash --scheduler "/bin/bash && env"
    ```

   These commands output all environment variables that are running locally. This includes environment variables set on Astro Runtime by default.

5. Optional. Run `astro deployment variable create --load` or `astro deployment variable update --load` to export environment variables from your `.env` file to a Deployment. You can view and modify the exported environment variables in the Cloud UI page for your Deployment.

:::info

For local environments, the Astro CLI generates an `airflow.cfg` file at runtime based on the environment variables you set in your `.env` file. You can’t create or modify `airflow.cfg` in an Astro project.

To view your local environment variables in the context of the generated Airflow configuration, run:

```sh
astro dev bash --scheduler "/bin/bash && cat airflow.cfg"
```

These commands output the contents of the generated `airflow.cfg` file, which lists your environment variables as human-readable configurations with inline comments.

:::

### Use multiple .env files

The Astro CLI looks for `.env` by default, but if you want to specify multiple files, make `.env` a top-level directory and create sub-files within that folder.

A project with multiple `.env` files might look like the following:

```
my_project
├── Dockerfile
├── dags
│   └── my_dag
├── plugins
│   └── my_plugin
├── airflow_settings.yaml
└── .env
    ├── dev.env
    └── prod.env
```

## Advanced configuration

The following configurations are specific to advanced use cases. 

### Add Airflow plugins 

If you need to build a custom view in the Airflow UI or build an application on top of the Airflow metadata database, you can use Airflow plugins. To use an Airflow plugin, add your plugin files to the `plugins` folder of your Astro project. To apply changes from this folder to a local Airflow environment, [restart your local environment](develop-project.md#restart-your-local-environment).

To learn more about Airflow plugins and how to build them, see [Airflow Plugins](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/authoring-and-scheduling/plugins.html) in Airflow documentation or the Astronomer [Airflow plugins](https://docs.astronomer.io/learn/using-airflow-plugins) guide.

### Use `.airflowignore`

You can create an `.airflowignore` file in the `dags` directory of your Astro project to identify the files to ignore when you deploy to Astro or develop locally. This can be helpful if your team has a single Git repository that contains DAGs for multiple projects.

The `.airflowignore` file and the files listed in it must be in the same `dags` directory of your Astro project. Files or directories listed in `.airflowignore` are not parsed by the Airflow scheduler and the DAGs listed in the file don't appear in the Airflow UI.

For more information about `.airflowignore`, see [`.airflowignore` in the Airflow documentation](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/core-concepts/dags.html#airflowignore). To learn more about the code deploy process, see [What happens during a code deploy](deploy-code.md#what-happens-during-a-code-deploy).

1. In the `dags` directory of your Astro project, create a new file named `.airflowignore`.

2. List the files or sub-directories you want ignored when you push code to Astro or when you are developing locally. You should list the path for each file or directory relative to the `dags` directory. For example: 

    ```text
    mydag.py
    data-team-dags
    some-dags/ignore-this-dag.py
    ``` 
    
3. Save your changes locally or deploy to Astro.

    Your local Airflow environment is automatically updated as soon as you save your changes to `.airflowignore`. To apply your change in Astro, you need to deploy. See [Deploy code](deploy-code.md).

### Run commands on build

To run additional commands as your Astro project is built into a Docker image, add them to your `Dockerfile` as `RUN` commands. These commands run as the last step in the image build process.

For example, if you want to run `ls` when your image builds, your `Dockerfile` would look like this:

<pre><code parentName="pre">{`FROM quay.io/astronomer/astro-runtime:${siteVariables.runtimeVersion}
RUN ls
`}</code></pre>

This is supported both on Astro and in the context of local development.

### Add a CA certificate to an Astro Runtime image

If you need your Astro Deployment to communicate securely with a remote service using a certificate signed by an untrusted or internal certificate authority (CA), you need to add the CA certificate to the trust store inside your Astro project's Docker image.

1. In your Astro project `Dockerfile`, add the following entry below the existing `FROM` statement which specifies your Astro Runtime image version:

    ```docker
    USER root
    COPY <internal-ca.crt>/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/<your-company-name>/
    RUN update-ca-certificates
    USER astro
    ```
    
2. Optional. Add additional `COPY` statements before the `RUN update-ca-certificates` stanza for each CA certificate your organization is using for external access.

3. [Restart your local environment](develop-project.md#restart-your-local-environment) or deploy to Astro. See [Deploy code](deploy-code.md).

### Install Python packages from private sources

Python packages can be installed into your image from public and private locations. To install packages listed on private PyPI indices or a private git-based repository, you need to complete additional configuration in your project.

Depending on where your private packages are stored, use one of the following setups to install these packages to an Astro project by customizing your Runtime image.

:::info

Deploying a custom Runtime image with a CI/CD pipeline requires additional configurations. For an example implementation, see [GitHub Actions CI/CD templates](ci-cd.md#github-actions).

#### Install Python packages from private GitHub repositories

This topic provides instructions for building your Astro project with Python packages from a private GitHub repository.

Although GitHub is used in this example, you should be able to complete the process with any hosted Git repository.

:::info

The following setup has been validated only with a single SSH key. You might need to modify this setup when using more than one SSH key per Docker image.

:::

#### Prerequisites

- The [Astro CLI](cli/overview.md)
- An [Astro project](develop-project.md#create-an-astro-project).
- Custom Python packages that are [installable with pip](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/)
- A private GitHub repository for each of your custom Python packages
- A [GitHub SSH private key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) authorized to access your private GitHub repositories

:::warning

If your organization enforces SAML single sign-on (SSO), you must first authorize your key to be used with that authentication method. See [Authorizing an SSH key for use with SAML single sign-on](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/authorizing-an-ssh-key-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on).

:::

This setup assumes that each custom Python package is hosted within its own private GitHub repository. Installing multiple custom packages from a single private GitHub repository is not supported.

#### Step 1: Specify the private repository in your project

To add a Python package from a private repository to your Astro project, specify the Secure Shell (SSH) URL for the repository in a new `private-requirements.txt` file. Use the following format for the SSH URL:

```
git+ssh://git@github.com/<your-github-organization-name>/<your-private-repository>.git
```

For example, to install `mypackage1` and `mypackage2` from `myorganization`, you would add the following to your `private-requirements.txt` file:

```
git+ssh://git@github.com/myorganization/mypackage1.git
git+ssh://git@github.com/myorganization/mypackage2.git
```

This example assumes that the name of each of your Python packages is identical to the name of its corresponding GitHub repository. In other words,`mypackage1` is both the name of the package and the name of the repository.

#### Step 2: Update Dockerfile

1. Optional. Copy and save any existing build steps in your `Dockerfile`.

2. Add `openssh-client` and `git` to your `packages.txt` file.

3. In your Dockerfile, add the following instructions:

    ```docker
    RUN mkdir -p -m 0700 ~/.ssh && \
        echo "github.com ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIOMqqnkVzrm0SdG6UOoqKLsabgH5C9okWi0dh2l9GKJl" >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts

    COPY private-requirements.txt .
    RUN --mount=type=ssh,id=github pip install --no-cache-dir --requirement private-requirements.txt
    ENV PATH="/home/astro/.local/bin:$PATH"
    ```

    In order, these instructions:

    - Add the fingerprint for GitHub to `known_hosts`
    - Copy your `private-requirements.txt` file into the image
    - Install Python-level packages from your private repository as specified in your `private-requirements.txt` file. This securely mounts your SSH key at build time, ensuring that the key itself is not stored in the resulting Docker image filesystem or metadata.
    - Add the user bin directory to `PATH`

  :::info

  If your repository isn't hosted on GitHub, replace the fingerprint with one from where the package is hosted. Use `ssh-keyscan` to generate the fingerprint.

  :::

#### Step 3: Build a custom Docker image

1. Run the following command to automatically generate a unique image name:

    ```sh
    image_name=astro-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)
    ```

2. Run the following command to create a new Docker image from your `Dockerfile`. Replace `<ssh-key>` with your SSH private key file name.

    ```sh
    DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -f Dockerfile --progress=plain --ssh=github="$HOME/.ssh/<ssh-key>" -t $image_name .
    ```

3. Optional. Test your DAGs locally. See [Restart your local environment](develop-project.md#restart-your-local-environment).

4. Deploy the image to Astro using the Astro CLI:

    ```sh
    astro deploy --image-name $image_name
    ```

Your Astro project can now utilize Python packages from your private GitHub repository.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="pypi">

#### Install Python packages from a private PyPI index

Installing Python packages on Astro from a private PyPI index is required for organizations that deploy a [private PyPI server (`private-pypi`)](https://pypi.org/project/private-pypi/) as a secure layer between pip and a Python package storage backend, such as GitHub, AWS, or a local file system or managed service.

To complete this setup, you’ll specify your privately hosted Python packages in `requirements.txt`, create a custom Docker image that changes where pip looks for packages, and then build your Astro project with this Docker image.

#### Prerequisites

- An [Astro project](develop-project.md#create-an-astro-project)
- A private PyPI index with a corresponding username and password

#### Step 1: Add Python packages to your Astro project

To install a Python package from a private PyPI index, add the package name and version to the `requirements.txt` file of your Astro project. If you don’t specify a version, the latest version is installed. Use the same syntax that you used when you added public packages from [PyPI](https://pypi.org). Your `requirements.txt` file can contain both publicly accessible and private packages.

:::caution

Make sure that the name of any privately hosted Python package doesn’t conflict with the name of other Python packages in your Astro project. The order in which pip searches indices might produce unexpected results.

:::

#### Step 2: Update Dockerfile

1. Optional. Copy and save any existing build steps in your `Dockerfile`.

2. In your `Dockerfile`, add `AS stage` to the `FROM` line which specifies your Runtime image. For example, if you use Runtime 5.0.0, your `FROM` line would be:

   ```text
   quay.io/astronomer/astro-runtime:5.0.0-base AS stage1
   ```

   :::info

   If you use the default distribution of Astro Runtime, replace your existing image with its corresponding `-base` image. The `-base` distribution is built to be customizable and does not include default build logic. For more information on Astro Runtime distributions, see [Distributions](runtime-version-lifecycle-policy.md#distribution).

   :::

3. After the `FROM` line specifying your Runtime image, add the following configuration:

    ```docker
    LABEL maintainer="Astronomer <humans@astronomer.io>"
    ARG BUILD_NUMBER=-1
    LABEL io.astronomer.docker=true
    LABEL io.astronomer.docker.build.number=$BUILD_NUMBER
    LABEL io.astronomer.docker.airflow.onbuild=true
    # Install OS-Level packages
    COPY packages.txt .
    USER root
    RUN apt-get update && cat packages.txt | xargs apt-get install -y
    USER astro

    FROM stage1 AS stage2
    # Install Python packages
    ARG PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL
    ENV PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL=${PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL}
    COPY requirements.txt .
    RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -q -r requirements.txt

    FROM stage1 AS stage3
    # Copy requirements directory
    COPY --from=stage2 /usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages /usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages
    COPY --from=stage2 /usr/local/bin /home/astro/.local/bin
    ENV PATH="/home/astro/.local/bin:$PATH"

    COPY . .
    ```

    In order, these commands:

    - Install any OS-level packages specified in `packages.txt`.
    - Add `PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL` as an environment variable that contains authentication information for your private PyPI index.
    - Install public and private Python-level packages from your `requirements.txt` file.

4. Optional. If you had any other commands in your original `Dockerfile`, add them after the line `FROM stage1 AS stage3`.

#### Step 3: Build a custom Docker image

1. Run the following command to automatically generate a unique image name:

    ```sh
    image_name=astro-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)
    ```

2. Run the following command to create a new Docker image from your `Dockerfile`. Replace `<private-pypi-repo-domain-name>`, `<repo-username>` and `<repo-password>` with your own values.

    ```sh
    DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -f Dockerfile --progress=plain --build-arg PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL=https://${<repo-username>}:${<repo-password>}@<private-pypi-repo-domain-name> -t $image_name .
    ```

3. Optional. Test your DAGs locally or deploy your image to Astro. See [Build and Run a Project Locally](develop-project.md#build-and-run-a-project-locally) or [Deploy Code to Astro](deploy-code.md).

    ```sh
    astro dev start --image-name $image_name
    ```
  
4. Optional. Deploy the image to a Deployment on Astro using the Astro CLI:

Your Astro project can now utilize Python packages from your private PyPi index.

## Unsupported project configurations 

You can't use `airflow.cfg` or `airflow_local_settings.py` files in an Astro project. `airflow_local_settings.py` has no effect on Astro Deployments, and `airflow.cfg` has no effect on local environments and Astro Deployments. 

An alternative to using `airflow.cfg` is to set Airflow environment variables in your `.env` file. See [Set environment variables locally](#set-environment-variables-locally).
