[CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) is a continuous integration and continuous delivery platform that can be used to implement DevOps practices. This document provides sample CI/CD templates to automate deploying Apache Airflow DAGs from a GitHub repository to Astro using CircleCI.

If you have one Deployment and one environment on Astro, use the _single branch implementation_. If you have multiple Deployments that support development and production environments, use the _multiple branch implementation_. If your team builds custom Docker images, use the _custom image_ implementation.

Refer to [Template overview](template-overview.md) to see generic templates expressed as simple shell scripts or configure your own. To learn more about CI/CD on Astro, see [Choose a CI/CD strategy](set-up-ci-cd.md).

## Prerequisites

- An [Astro project](develop-project.md#create-an-astro-project) hosted in a Git repository that CircleCI can access.
- An [Astro Deployment](create-deployment.md).
- Either a [Workspace API token](workspace-api-tokens.md) or an [Organization API token](organization-api-tokens.md).
- A [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/vcs-authorize/) account.

## Image-only templates

[Image-only deploy templates](template-overview.md#template-types) build a Docker image and push it to Astro whenever you update any file in your Astro project.

To automate code deploys to a Deployment using CircleCI for a single branch implementation, complete the following setup in a Git-based repository that hosts an Astro project:

#### Configuration requirements

- You have a `main` branch of an Astro project hosted in a single GitHub repository.
- You have a production Deployment on Astro where you want to deploy your `main` GitHub branch.
- You have a production CircleCI context that stores environment variables for your CI/CD workflows.

#### Implementation

1. Set the following environment variables in a [CircleCI context](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/contexts/):

    - `ASTRO_API_TOKEN`: The value for your Workspace or Organization API token.
    - `ASTRO_DEPLOYMENT_ID`: The ID for your Deployment.

2. Create a new YAML file in `.circleci/config.yml` that includes the following configuration:

    ```yaml
    # Use the latest CircleCI pipeline process engine version.
    # See: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference
    version: 2.1

    orbs:
      docker: circleci/docker@2.0.1
      github-cli: circleci/github-cli@2.0.0

    # Define a job to be invoked later in a workflow.
    # See: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#jobs
    jobs:

      build_image_and_deploy:
        docker:
          - image: cimg/base:stable
        # Add steps to the job
        # See: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#steps
        steps:
          - setup_remote_docker:
              version: 20.10.11
          - checkout
          - run:
              name: "Deploy to Astro"
              command: |
                curl -sSL install.astronomer.io | sudo bash -s
                astro deploy ${ASTRO_DEPLOYMENT_ID} -f

    # Invoke jobs with workflows
    # See: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#workflows
    workflows:
      version: 2.1
      wf-build-and-deploy:
        jobs:
          - build_image_and_deploy:
              context:
                - <YOUR-CIRCLE-CI-CONTEXT>
              filters:
                branches:
                  only:
                    - <YOUR-BRANCH-NAME>
    ```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="multibranch">

The following template can be used to create a multiple branch CI/CD pipeline using CircleCI. A multiple branch pipeline can be used to test DAGs in a development Deployment and promote them to a production Deployment. 

#### Configuration requirements

- You have both a `dev` and `main` branch of an Astro project hosted in a single GitHub repository.
- You have respective development and production Deployments on Astro where you deploy your GitHub branches to.
- You have respective development and production CircleCI contexts that store environment variables to use in your CI/CD workflows.

#### Implementation

1. Set the following environment variables in both your production and development [CircleCI contexts](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/contexts/):

   - `ASTRO_API_TOKEN` = `<your-workspace-or-organization-api-token-with-access-to-prod-deployment>`
   - `ASTRO_DEPLOYMENT_ID` = `<your-prod-deployment-id>`

2. Create a new YAML file in `.circleci/config.yml` that includes the following configuration:

    ```yaml
    # Use the latest CircleCI pipeline process engine version.
    # See: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference
    version: 2.1

    orbs:
      docker: circleci/docker@2.0.1
      github-cli: circleci/github-cli@2.0.0

    # Define a job to be invoked later in a workflow.
    # See: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#jobs
    jobs:

      build_image_and_deploy:
        docker:
          - image: cimg/base:stable
        # Add steps to the job
        # See: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#steps
        steps:
          - setup_remote_docker:

        jobs:
          - build_image_and_deploy:
              context:
                - <YOUR-PROD-CIRCLE-CI-CONTEXT>
              filters:
                branches:
                  only:
                    - <YOUR-PRODUCTION-BRANCH-NAME>
        jobs:
          - build_image_and_deploy:
              context:
                - <YOUR-DEV-CIRCLE-CI-CONTEXT>
              filters:
                branches:
                  only:
                    - <YOUR-DEVELOPMENT-BRANCH-NAME>
    ```

If your Astro project requires additional build-time arguments to build an image, you need to define these build arguments in `docker build` command and then use the `image tag` to deploy to Astro. See [`docker build`](https://docs.docker.com/build/guide/build-args/) for reference.

#### Configuration requirements

- You have a `main` branch of an Astro project hosted in a single GitHub repository.
- You have a production Deployment on Astro where you want to deploy your `main` GitHub branch.
- You have a production CircleCI context where you store environment variables to use in your CI/CD workflow.s

## DAG-based templates

A [DAG-based template](template-overview#dag-based-templates) uses the `--dags` flag in the Astro CLI `astro depoy` command to push only DAGs to your Deployment. This CI/CD pipeline deploys your DAGs only when files in your `dags` folder are modified whereas it deploys the rest of your Astro project as a Docker image when other files or directories are also modified. For more information about the benefits of this workflow, see [Deploy DAGs only](deploy-code.md#deploy-dags-only).

### Configuration requirements

For each Deployment that you use with DAG-based templates, you must [enable DAG deploys](deploy-code.md#deploy-dags-only).

### Single branch implementation

To automate code deploys to a Deployment using [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), complete the following setup in a Git-based repository that hosts an Astro project:

1. Set the following environment variables in a [CircleCI context](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/contexts/):

    - `ASTRO_API_TOKEN`: The value for your Workspace or Organization API token.
    - `ASTRO_DEPLOYMENT_ID`: The ID for your Deployment.

2. In your project repository, create a new YAML file in `.circleci/config.yml` that includes the following configuration:

    ```yaml
    # Use the latest CircleCI pipeline process engine version.
    # See: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference
    version: 2.1

    orbs:
      docker: circleci/docker@2.0.1
      github-cli: circleci/github-cli@2.0.0

    # Define a job to be invoked later in a workflow.
    # See: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#jobs
    jobs:

      build_image_and_deploy:
        docker:
          - image: cimg/base:stable
        # Add steps to the job
        # See: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#steps
        steps:
          - setup_remote_docker:
              version: 20.10.11
          - checkout
          - run:
              name: "Build image and deploy"
              command: |
                curl -sSL install.astronomer.io | sudo bash -s
                files=($(git diff-tree HEAD --name-only --no-commit-id))
                echo ${files}
                find="dags"
                if [[ ${files[*]} =~ (^|[[:space:]])"$find"($|[[:space:]]) && ${#files[@]} -eq 1 ]]; then
                  echo "only deploying dags"
                  astro deploy ${ASTRO_DEPLOYMENT_ID} --dags -f;
                else
                  echo "image deploy"
                  astro deploy ${ASTRO_DEPLOYMENT_ID} -f;
                fi

    # Invoke jobs with workflows
    # See: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#workflows
    workflows:
      version: 2.1
      wf-build-and-deploy:
        jobs:
          - build_image_and_deploy:
              context:
                - <YOUR-CIRCLE-CI-CONTEXT>
              filters:
                branches:
                  only:
                    - <YOUR-BRANCH-NAME>
    ```

This script checks the diff between your current commit and the HEAD of your branch to which you are pushing the changes to. If the changes are only in `dags` then it executes a `dag-only` deploy. Otherwise, it executes an image-based deploy. Make sure to customize the script to use your specific branch and context. 

You can customize this script to work for multiple branches as shown in the [image-based multi-branch deploy template](circleci?tab=multibranch#image-only-templates) by creating separate `job` and `workflow` for each branch.
