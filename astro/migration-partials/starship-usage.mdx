You might have defined Airflow connections and variables in the following places on your source Airflow environment:

- The Airflow UI (stored in the Airflow metadata database).
- Environment variables
- A secrets backend.

If you defined your Airflow variables and connections in the Airflow UI, you can migrate those to Astro with Starship. You can check which resources will be migrated by going to **Admin** > **Variables** and **Admin** > **Connections** in the Airflow UI to find your source Airflow environment information.

:::caution

Some environment variables or Airflow Settings, like global environment variable values, can't be migrated to Astro. See [Global environment variables](https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/platform-variables) for a list of variables that you can't migrate to Astro.

1. In the Airflow UI for your source Airflow environment, go to **Astronomer** > **Migration Tool 🚀**.

    ![Location of the Astro migration menu in the Cloud UI](/img/docs/migration-menu.png)

2. Click **Get Token**.
3. If required, sign in to [cloud.astronomer.io](https://cloud.astronomer.io).
4. Copy the access token that appears after logging in. 
5. In the **Migration Tool 🚀** page of the Airflow UI, paste the access token into the **Authentication Token** field.
6. Click **Sign in**.
7. In the **Target Deployment** menu, select the Deployment where you want to migrate your Airflow variables and connections, then click **Select**.
8. Click **Connections**. In the table that appears, click **Migrate** for each connection that you want to migrate to Astro. After the migration is complete, the status **Migrated ✅** appears.
9. Click **Variables**.
10. In the table that appears, click **Migrate** for each variable that you want to migrate to Astro. After the migration is complete, the status **Migrated ✅** appears.
11. Click **Environment variables**.
12. In the table that appears, check the box for each environment variable that you want to migrate to Astro, then click **Migrate**. After the migration is complete, the status **Migrated ✅** appears.

Refer to the [Configuration](https://github.com/astronomer/starship/tree/master/astronomer-starship-provider#configuration) detailed instructions on using the operator.

1. Add the following DAG to your source Airflow environment:

    ```python
    from airflow import DAG
    from astronomer.starship.operators import AstroMigrationOperator
    from datetime import datetime

    with DAG(
      dag_id="astronomer_migration_dag",
      start_date=datetime(1970, 1, 1),
      schedule_interval=None,
    ) as dag:
      AstroMigrationOperator(
          task_id='export_meta',
          deployment_url='{{ dag_run.conf["deployment_url"] }}',
          token='{{ dag_run.conf["astro_token"] }}',
      )
    ```
2. Deploy this DAG to your source Airflow environment.
3. Once the DAG is available in the Airflow UI, click **Trigger DAG**, then click **Trigger DAG w/ config**. 
4. In **Configuration JSON**, add the following configuration:

    ```json
    {
        "deployment_url": "<your-deployment-url>",
        "astro_token": "<your-astro-token>"
    }
    ```

5. Replace the following placeholder values:

    - `<your-deployment-url>`: To retrieve a deployment URL, open your Astro Airflow Deployment in the Cloud UI, click **Open Airflow**, and copy the Airflow UI URL excluding `/home` on the end of the URL. For example, if your deployment URL is `https://astronomer.astronomer.run/abcdt4ry/home`, you would enter `https://astronomer.astronomer.run/abcdt4ry`.
    - `<your-astro-token>`: To retrieve an Astronomer token, go to [cloud.astronomer.io/token](https://cloud.astronomer.io/token) and log in using your Astro credentials. After you log in, copy the token that appears and paste it as the value.

6. Click **Trigger**. After the DAG successfully runs, all connections, variables, and environment variables that are available from the Airflow UI are migrated to Astronomer.
