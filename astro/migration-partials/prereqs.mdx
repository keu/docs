Before starting the migration, ensure that the following are true:

- You have an Astro user account and can [log in to Astro](log-in-to-astro.md).
- (Optional) You [connected external cloud resources](https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/category/connect-to-external-resources) to Astro.
- (Optional) You [configured your identity provider (IdP)](configure-idp.md).

On your local machine, make sure you have:

- An [Astro account](log-in-to-astro.md).
- The [Astro CLI](cli/install-cli.md).

On the cloud service from which you're migrating, ensure that you have:

- A source Airflow environment on Airflow 2 or later.
- Read access to the source Airflow environment.
- Read access to any cloud storage buckets that store your DAGs.
- Read access to any source control tool that hosts your current Airflow code, such as GitHub.
- Permission to create new repositories on your source control tool.
- (Optional) Access to your secrets backend.
- (Optional) Permission to create new CI/CD pipelines. 

All source Airflow environments on 1.x need to be upgraded to at least Airflow 2.0 before you can migrate them. Astronomer professional services can help you with the upgrade process.
