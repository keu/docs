:::info  

The behavior and format of this command differs depending on what Astronomer product you're using. Use the following tabs to change between product contexts.

<Tabs
    defaultValue="astro"

[Deploy code](deploy-code.md) to a Deployment on Astro.

This command bundles all files in your Astro project and pushes them to Astro. Before completing the process, it tests your DAGs in your Astro project for errors. If this test fails, the deploy to Astro will also fail. This is the same test which runs locally with `astro dev parse`.

When you run `astro deploy`, you'll be prompted to select from a list of all Deployments that you can access across Workspaces. To bypass this prompt, you can also specify a Deployment ID in the command. To retrieve a Deployment ID, open your Deployment in the Cloud UI and copy the value in the **ID** section of the Deployment page. You can also run `astro deployment list` to find a Deployment ID or name.

For teams operating at scale, this command can be automated with a [CI/CD pipeline](set-up-ci-cd.md) by using [Deployment API keys](api-keys.md) in the request. When `ASTRONOMER_KEY_ID` and `ASTRONOMER_KEY_SECRET` are specified as OS-level environment variables on your local machine or in a CI tool, `astro deploy <deployment-id>` can be run without requiring user authentication.

:::tip

To skip the parsing process before deploys, complete one of the following setups:

- Add `skip_parse: true` to `.astro/config.yaml` in your Astro project.
- Add `ASTRONOMER_SKIP_PARSE=true` as an environment variable to your local environment or CI/CD pipeline.

[Deploy code](deploy-code.md) to a Deployment on Astronomer Software.

This command bundles all files in your Astro project and pushes them to Astronomer Software. 

When you run `astro deploy`, you'll be prompted to select from a list of all Deployments that you can access in all Workspaces. To bypass this prompt, you can specify a Deployment ID in the command. To retrieve a Deployment ID, go to your Deployment's information page in the Cloud UI and copy the value after the last `/` in the URL. You can also run `astro deployment list` to retrieve a Deployment ID .
