Export Airflow variables, connections, and pools from a locally running environment to a local file and format of your choice. By default, the command exports all Airflow objects to the `airflow_settings.yaml` file in your Astro project.

## Usage 

After starting your local Airflow environment with `astro dev start`, run:

```sh
astro dev object export
```

By default, the command exports all variables, connections, and pools as YAML configurations to `airflow_settings.yaml`.
