Export Airflow variables, connections, and pools from a locally running environment to a file and format of your choice. 

## Usage 

After starting your local Airflow environment with `astro dev start`, run:

```sh
astro dev object export [flags]
```

By default, the command exports all variables, connections, and pools as YAML configurations to `airflow_settings.yaml`.
