## Description

Force-stop and remove all running containers for your local Airflow environment. Unlike [`astro dev stop`](astro-dev-stop.md), which only pauses running containers, `astro dev kill` will delete all data associated with your local Postgres database. This includes Airflow connections, logs, and task history.

For more information, read [Hard Reset Your Local Environment](test-and-troubleshoot-locally.md#hard-reset-your-local-environment) or [Build and Run a Project Locally](develop-project.md#build-and-run-a-project-locally).

## Usage

```sh
astro dev kill
```

## Related Commands
