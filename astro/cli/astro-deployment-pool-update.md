Update the value for a Deployment's Airflow pool. 

## Usage

```sh
astro deployment airflow-pool update
```

:::tip

To run this command in an automated process such as a [CI/CD pipeline](set-up-ci-cd.md), set the following OS-level environment pools in a way that the Astro CLI can access them:

- `ASTRONOMER_KEY_ID`
- `ASTRONOMER_KEY_SECRET`

After setting the pools, this command works for a Deployment without you having to manually authenticate to Astronomer. Astronomer recommends storing `ASTRONOMER_KEY_SECRET` as a secret before using it to programmatically update production-level Deployments.
