## Examples 

```sh
astro deployment worker-queue create --deployment-id cl03oiq7d80402nwn7fsl3dmv
# Creates a new worker queue for a Deployment with ID `cl03oiq7d80402nwn7fsl3dmv`. The Astro CLI prompts you for configuration information.

astro deployment worker-queue create --concurrency 20 --max-count 10 --min-count 2 --name "My worker queue" --worker-type "m5d.8xlarge"
# Creates a new worker queue with specified configurations. The Astro CLI prompts you for Deployment information.
