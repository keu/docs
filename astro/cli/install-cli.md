<TabItem value="mac">

Install the Astro CLI on a Mac operating system with a single command.

#### Prerequisites

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (v18.09 or higher).

#### Installation

To install the latest version of the Astro CLI, run the following command:

```sh
brew install astro
```

To install a specific version of the Astro CLI, specify the version you want to install at the end of the command:

```sh
brew install astro@<major.minor.patch-version>
```

If you specify only a major version, this command installs the latest minor or patch version available for the major version. For a list of all available versions, see the [CLI release notes](cli/release-notes.md). If you specify only a major version, this command installs the latest minor or patch version available for the major version. For a list of all available versions, see the [CLI release notes](cli/release-notes.md).

<TabItem value="windows">

This is where you'll find information about installing the Astro CLI on a Windows operating system.

#### Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/) for Windows.
- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (v1.13.1 or later).
- [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) enabled on your local machine.
- Windows 10 or Windows 11.

#### Installation

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-cli/releases) of the Astro CLI GitHub repository, scroll to a CLI version, and then download the `.exe` file that matches the CPU architecture of your machine.

    For example, to install v1.0.0 of the Astro CLI on a Windows machine with an AMD 64 architecture, download `astro_1.0.0-converged_windows_amd64.exe`.

2. Rename the file to `astro.exe`.

3. Add the filepath for the directory containing the new `astro.exe` as a PATH environment variable. For example, if `astro.exe` is stored in `C:\Users\username\astro.exe`, you add `C:\Users\username` as your PATH environment variable. To learn more about configuring the PATH environment variable, see [How do I set or change the PATH system variable?](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html).

4. Restart your machine.

<TabItem value="windows with winget">

Starting with Astro CLI version 1.6, you can use the winget command line tool to install the Astro CLI. If you're installing an older version of the Astro CLI, you'll need to follow the [alternate Windows installation process](https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/cli/install-cli?tab=windows#install-the-astro-cli).

The winget command line tool is supported on Windows 10 1709 (build 16299) or later, and is bundled with Windows 11 and modern versions of Windows 10 by default as the App Installer. If you're running an earlier version of Windows 10 and you don't have the App Installer installed, you can download it from the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/app-installer/9NBLGGH4NNS1?hl=en-ca&gl=ca). If you've installed the App Installer previously, make sure you're using the latest version before running commands.

#### Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/) for Windows.
- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (v1.13.1 or later).
- [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) enabled on your local machine.
- Astro CLI version 1.6 or later.
- The latest version of the Windows [App Installer](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/app-installer/9NBLGGH4NNS1?hl=en-ca&gl=ca).
- Windows 10 1709 (build 16299) or later or Windows 11.

#### Installation

Open Windows PowerShell and then run the following command:

```sh
winget install -e --id Astronomer.Astro
```

To install a specific version of the Astro CLI, specify the version you want to install at the end of the command. For example:

```sh
winget install -e --id Astronomer.Astro -v 1.6.0
```

<TabItem value="linux">

This is where you'll find information about installing the Astro CLI on Linux.

#### Prerequisites

- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (v1.13.1 or higher).

#### Installation

Run the following command to install the latest version of the Astro CLI directly to `PATH`:

```sh
curl -sSL install.astronomer.io | sudo bash -s
```

To install a specific version of the CLI, specify the version number as a flag at the end of the command. For example, to install v1.1.0 of the CLI, you would run:

```sh
curl -sSL install.astronomer.io | sudo bash -s -- v1.1.0
```

If you specify only a major version, this command installs the latest minor or patch version available for the major version. If you specify only a major version, this command installs the latest minor or patch version available for the major version. For a list of all available versions, see the [CLI release notes](cli/release-notes.md).

## Migrate from `astrocloud` to `astro`

The `astrocloud` executable is no longer maintained by Astronomer. Complete this migration if all of the following are true:

- You are an Astro user.
- You're currently using the `astrocloud` CLI executable.

For more information on Astro CLI version 1.0.0, see [Astro CLI Release Notes](cli/release-notes.md).

### Step 1: Uninstall `astrocloud`

<Tabs
    defaultValue="mac"
    groupId= "step-1-uninstall-astrocloud"
    values={[
        {label: 'Mac', value: 'mac'},
        {label: 'Windows', value: 'windows'},
        {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="mac">

To uninstall `astrocloud` on Mac, run:

```sh
brew uninstall astronomer/cloud/astrocloud
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windows">

To uninstall `astrocloud` on Windows:

1. Delete the filepath for `astrocloud.exe` from your Windows PATH environment variable.
2. Delete `astrocloud.exe` from your machine.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="linux">

To uninstall `astrocloud` on Linux:

1. Delete the filepath for `astrocloud.exe` from your Linux PATH environment variable.
2. Delete `astrocloud.exe` from your machine.

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Step 2: Install Astro CLI v1.0+

Install the latest version of `astro` on your machine. See [Install the CLI](cli/install-cli.md).

### Step 3: Migrate existing Astro projects

To run and deploy your existing Astro projects using the `astro` executable, you need to populate these projects with a new `.astro` directory.

1. In your terminal, go to the location of your Astro project.
2. Run `astro dev init` to generate a new `.astro` directory in your project. This subdirectory might be hidden in graphical file browsers. You can show hidden files using `⌘ + Shift + .` on Mac or by selecting **View > Hidden items** in Windows file explorer.

    If a prompt appears asking you about whether you want to create a project in a directory that isn't empty, enter `Yes`. The CLI only creates files that aren't in your directory. In this case, the only files that it creates are `./astro/test_dag_integrity_default.py` and `.astro/config.yaml`.

### Step 4: Migrate project configurations (_Optional_)

If you manually updated the `.astrocloud/config.yaml` file of an existing Astro project:

1. In your terminal, go to the location of your Astro project.
2. Copy the contents from `.astrocloud/config.yaml` into `.astro/config.yaml`.
3. Delete `.astrocloud/config.yaml` from your project.

### Step 5: Update CI/CD pipelines (_Optional_)

If you have an existing [CI/CD](ci-cd.md) pipeline that uses the `astrocloud` executable, update it to use `astro`. For example, in a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline you would update the following:

```yaml
# Before:
    - name: Deploy to Astro
      run: |
        brew install astronomer/cloud/astrocloud
        astrocloud deploy ${{ secrets.DEPLOYMENT_ID }}

# After:
    - name: Deploy to Astro
      run: |
        curl -sSL install.astronomer.io | sudo bash -s
        astro deploy ${{ secrets.DEPLOYMENT_ID }}
```
