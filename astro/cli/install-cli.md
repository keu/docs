## Install the Astro CLI

    values={[
        {label: 'Mac', value: 'mac'},
        {label: 'Windows with winget', value: 'windowswithwinget'},

        {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="mac">

Install the Astro CLI on a Mac operating system with a single command.

#### Prerequisites

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- Optional. [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (v18.09 or higher).

By default, the Astro CLI uses Docker as its container management engine for running Airflow locally. However, if your organization uses Podman to run and manage containers, you can configure the Astro CLI to use it instead. See [Run the Astro CLI with Podman](cli/configure-cli.md?tab=mac#run-the-astro-cli-using-podman) for prerequisites and configuration steps.

#### Installation

To install the latest version of the Astro CLI, run the following command:

```sh
brew install astro
```

To install a specific version of the Astro CLI, specify the version you want to install at the end of the command:

```sh
brew install astro@<major.minor.patch-version>
```

If you specify only a major version, this command installs the latest minor or patch version available for the major version. For a list of all available versions, see the [CLI release notes](/astro/cli/release-notes.md).

#### Confirmation

To verify that the correct Astro CLI version was installed, run:

```sh
astro version
```

#### Resolve installation issues

Follow this procedure when Homebrew fails to install the latest Astro CLI version or the error `No formulae or casks found for astro@<major.minor.patch-version>` appears. To troubleshoot other Homebrew issues, see [Common Issues](https://docs.brew.sh/Common-Issues) in the Homebrew documentation.

1. Run the following command to update Homebrew and all package definitions (formulae):

    ```sh
    brew update
    ```

2. Install the Astro CLI. See [Installation](cli/install-cli.md?tab=mac#installation).

<TabItem value="windowswithwinget">

Starting with Astro CLI version 1.6, you can use the Windows Package Manager winget command-line tool to install the Astro CLI. To install an older version of the Astro CLI, you'll need to follow the [alternate Windows installation process](https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/cli/install-cli?tab=windows#install-the-astro-cli).

The winget command line tool is supported on Windows 10 1709 (build 16299) or later, and is bundled with Windows 11 and modern versions of Windows 10 by default as the App Installer. If you're running an earlier version of Windows 10 and you don't have the App Installer installed, you can download it from the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/app-installer/9NBLGGH4NNS1?hl=en-ca&gl=ca). If you've installed the App Installer previously, make sure you're using the latest version before running commands.

#### Prerequisites

- Microsoft Hyper-V enabled. See [How to Enable Hyper-V On Windows](https://www.wintips.org/how-to-enable-hyper-v-on-windows-10-11-home/).
- The latest version of the Windows [App Installer](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/app-installer/9NBLGGH4NNS1?hl=en-ca&gl=ca).
- Windows 10 1709 (build 16299) or later or Windows 11.
- Optional. [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (v18.09 or higher).

By default, the Astro CLI uses Docker as its container management engine for running Airflow locally. However, if your organization uses Podman to run and manage containers, you can configure the Astro CLI to use it instead. See [Run the Astro CLI with Podman](cli/configure-cli.md?tab=mac#run-the-astro-cli-using-podman) for prerequisites and configuration steps.

#### Installation

1. Open Windows PowerShell as an administrator and then run the following command:

    ```sh
    winget install -e --id Astronomer.Astro
    ```

    To install a specific version of the Astro CLI, specify the version you want to install at the end of the command. For example, running the following command specifies the latest available version of the Astro CLI:

<pre><code parentName="pre">{`winget install -e --id Astronomer.Astro -v ${siteVariables.cliVersion}`}</code></pre>

2. Run the following command to access the location of the CLI executable:

    ```sh
    $env:path.split(";")
    ```
    
    From the text that appears, copy the path for the Astro CLI executable. It should be similar to `C:\Users\myname\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WinGet\Packages\Astronomer.Astro_Microsoft.Winget.Source_8wekyb3d8bbwe`. 

3. Paste the path into File Explorer or open the file path in terminal, then rename the Astro executable to `astro.exe`.

4. Run `astro version` to confirm the Astro CLI is installed properly.

#### Resolve installation issues

If an error message appears indicating that the term winget is not recognized as an internal or external command when you attempt to run winget commands, see this [troubleshooting document](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/tree/master/doc/troubleshooting#common-issues) provided by Microsoft.

This is where you'll find information about installing the Astro CLI on a Windows operating system. Starting with Astro CLI version 1.6, you can use the Windows Package Manager winget command-line tool to install the Astro CLI. See [Windows with winget](install-cli.md?tab=windows%20with%20winget#install-the-astro-cli).

#### Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/).
- Microsoft Hyper-V enabled. See [How to Enable Hyper-V On Windows](https://www.wintips.org/how-to-enable-hyper-v-on-windows-10-11-home/).
- Windows 10 or Windows 11.

By default, the Astro CLI uses Docker as its container management engine. However, if your organization uses Podman to run and manage containers, you can configure the Astro CLI to use it instead. See [Run the Astro CLI with Podman](cli/configure-cli.md?tab=mac#run-the-astro-cli-using-podman) for prerequisites and configuration steps.

#### Installation

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-cli/releases) of the Astro CLI GitHub repository, scroll to a CLI version, and then download the `.exe` file that matches the CPU architecture of your machine.

    For example, to install v1.0.0 of the Astro CLI on a Windows machine with an AMD 64 architecture, download `astro_1.0.0-converged_windows_amd64.exe`.

2. Rename the file to `astro.exe`.

3. Add the filepath for the directory containing the new `astro.exe` as a PATH environment variable. For example, if `astro.exe` is stored in `C:\Users\username\astro.exe`, you add `C:\Users\username` as your PATH environment variable. To learn more about configuring the PATH environment variable, see [How do I set or change the PATH system variable?](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html).

4. Restart your machine.

<pre><code parentName="pre">{`curl -sSL install.astronomer.io | sudo bash -s -- v${siteVariables.cliVersion}`}</code></pre>

If you specify only a major version, this command installs the latest minor or patch version available for the major version.
