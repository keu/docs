:::info  

The behavior and format of this command differs depending on what Astronomer product you're using. Use the following tabs to change product contexts. 

:::

<Tabs
    defaultValue="astro"
    values={[
        {label: 'Astro', value: 'astro'},
        {label: 'Software', value: 'software'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="astro">

Delete a Deployment on Astro. This command is functionally identical to deleting a Deployment in the Cloud UI.

When you run `astro deployment delete`, you are prompted to select from a list of Deployments that you can access in your Workspace. You can bypass this prompt and specify a Deployment name or ID in the command. To retrieve a Deployment ID, open your Deployment in the Cloud UI and copy the value in the **ID** section of the Deployment page. You can also run `astro deployment list` to find a Deployment ID or name.

:::info

To complete this action, [Workspace Admin](user-permissions.md#workspace-roles) permissions are required.

:::

## Usage

```sh
astro deployment delete
```
