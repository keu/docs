:::info 

This command is available only if you're authenticated to an Astronomer Software installation. 

:::

Manage Deployment-level Teams on Astronomer Software. 

## Usage

This command includes three subcommands: `create`, `delete`, and `list`

```sh
astro deployment team add --deployment-id=<your-deployment-id> <team-id>
astro deployment team list <deployment-id>
astro deployment team --deployment-id=<your-deployment-id> <team-id> 
astro deployment team remove --deployment-id=<your-deployment-id> <team-id>
```

You can retrieve a Team's ID in one of two ways:

- Access the Team in the Software UI and copy the last part of the URL in your web browser. For example, if your Team is located at `BASEDOMAIN.astronomer.io/w/cx897fds98csdcsdafasdot8g7/team/cl4iqjamcnmfgigl4852flfgulye`, your Team ID is `cl4iqjamcnmfgigl4852flfgulye`.
- Run [`astro workspace team list`](cli/astro-workspace-team.md#astro-workspace-team-list) and copy the value in the `ID` column.
