description: A list of environment variables that are set globally on Astro and should not be modified.
---

This document is a reference for all environment variables on Astronomer with different default values than open source Apache Airflow. You can override [default Runtime environment variables](#default-runtime-environment-variables), but you can't override [system environment variables](#system-environment-variables).

For information on setting your own environment variables, see [Environment variables](environment-variables.md).

## System environment variables

On Astro, certain environment variables have preset values that are required and should not be overridden by your team. The following table provides information about each global environment variable set by Astronomer.

:::warning 

The Cloud UI does not currently prevent you from setting these environment variables, but attempting to set them can result in unexpected behavior that can include access problems, missing task logs, and failed tasks.

If you need to set one of these variables for a particular use case, contact [Astronomer support](https://cloud.astronomer.io/support).

:::info 

¹ The `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` environment variables are required only for Deployments running on AWS. For any Deployment running on an AWS cluster, they should not be overridden.

There are no restrictions with setting these values for Deployments running on GCP and Azure.

## Default Runtime environment variables

Astro Runtime images include baked-in environment variables that have different default values than on Apache Airflow. See [Astro Runtime image architecture](runtime-image-architecture.md) for a complete list of variables and values.
