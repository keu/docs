This guide provides the steps for integrating identity providers on Astro to enable Single Sign-On (SSO) for your users. After you complete the integration for your organization:

- Users will automatically be authenticated to Astro if they're already logged in to your identity provider (IdP).
- Users will no longer have to repeatedly login and remember credentials for their account.
- You will have complete ownership over credential configuration and management on Astro.
- You can enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for users.
- You can use services such as [Adaptive Authentication](https://www.okta.com/identity-101/adaptive-authentication/) and [Conditional Access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview) to create advanced access policies that enforce trusted IP ranges or limit access to authorized devices.

To manage Organization users after you have configured SSO, see [Manage Astro users](add-user.md).

In addition to SSO authorization, there are 3 ways that users can to authenticate to Astro:

- Basic authentication (username and password)
- Google social login
- GitHub social login

To limit users to only a subset of these options, see [Restrict authentication options](#restrict-authentication-options).

## Supported SSO identity providers

Single Sign On (SSO) authorization allows users to log in using their company credentials, managed through an IdP. This provides a streamlined login experience for your Astro users, as they are able to leverage the same credentials across multiple applications. In addition, this provides improved security and control for organizations to manage access from a single source. Astro supports integrations with the following IdPs:

- [Azure Active Directory (AD)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/)
- [Okta](https://www.okta.com/)
- [OneLogin](https://www.onelogin.com/)
- [Ping Identity](https://www.pingidentity.com/en.html)

:::info

You can configure multiple SSO connections for a single Organization. This requires having a unique [verified domain](manage-domains.md) for each new SSO connection.

:::

## Configure your SSO identity provider

At a high level, to configure an SSO identity provider (IdP) you will:

1. Create a connection between Astro and your IdP.
2. Map a managed domain to your SSO connection.
3. Invite users to Astro through your IdP.

<Tabs
    defaultValue="Okta"
    groupId= "configure-your-identity-provider"
    values={[
        {label: 'Okta', value: 'Okta'},
        {label: 'Azure AD', value: 'Azure AD'},
        {label: 'OneLogin', value: 'OneLogin'},
        {label: 'Ping Identity', value: 'Ping Identity'},
    ]}>
<TabItem value="Okta">

This section provides setup steps for setting up Okta as your IdP on Astro. After completing this setup, all users in your organization can use Okta to log in to Astro.

#### Prerequisites

- [Organization Owner](user-permissions.md) privileges in the Organization you're configuring.
- An [Okta account](https://www.okta.com/) with administrative access.
- At least one [verified domain](manage-domains.md).

#### Step 1: Create a SAML-based connection to Okta

To set up Okta as your IdP, you will create a Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) connection to Okta.

1. In the Cloud UI, click **Settings**, then click **Authentication**.
2. In the **SSO Configuration** menu, click **Configure SSO**.
3. Configure the following values for your connection:

    - **Connection type**: Select **SAML**.
    - **SSO Domain(s)**: Enter the verified domain(s) that you want to map to Okta.
    - **Automatic Membership**: Set the default role for users who join your Organization through Okta and without an explicit invite from Astro.

4. Copy the **Single Sign-On URL** and **Audience URI (SP ENTITY ID)** for the next step.
5. Open a new tab and go to Okta. In the Okta Admin Console, create a SAML app integration. See [Create SAML app integrations using AIW](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Apps/Apps_App_Integration_Wizard_SAML.htm). Complete the following fields:

    - **App logo**: (Optional) Use the [official Astronomer monogram asset](https://github.com/astronomer/docs/tree/main/static/img/assets/astronomer-monogram-rgb-600px.png) hosted on GitHub.
    - **Single sign on URL**: `<your-sso-url>`
    - **Audience URI (SP Entity ID)**: `<your-audience-uri>`
    - **Name ID format**: `Unspecified`
    - **Application username**: `Email`
    - **Update application username on**: `Create and update`
  
6. In the **Advanced Settings** section of your configuration, set the following values:

    - **Response**: `Signed`
    - **Assertion Signature**: `Signed`
    - **Signature Algorithm**: `RSA-SHA256`
    - **Digest Algorithm**: `SHA256`
    - **Assertion Encryption**: `Unencrypted`

7. In the **Attribute Statements** section of your configuration, create the following four attribute statements, making sure to use the exact capitalization as shown:

    | Name      | Name Format | Value            |
    | --------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
    | email     | Unspecified | user.email       |
    | firstName | Unspecified | user.firstName   |
    | lastName  | Unspecified | user.lastName    |
    | name      | Unspecified | user.displayName |

  :::info

  These values might be different if Okta is connected to an Active Directory. In this case, replace each `Value` with the equivalent Active Directory values for a user's first name, last name, and full email address.

  :::

8. Complete the remainder of the setup as documented in Okta until you finish creating your integration.
9. On the page for your Okta app integration, click **View Setup Instructions**. Copy the values for **Single Sign-On URL** and **X.509 Certificate** that appear. 
10. Assign yourself to the Astro app integration from Okta. See [Assign an app integration to a user](https://help.okta.com/en-us/Content/Topics/Provisioning/lcm/lcm-assign-app-user.htm).
11. Return to the Cloud UI. In the configuration screen for your SAML connection, configure the following values:

    - **Identity Provider Single Sign-on URL**: Enter your **Single Sign-on URL**.
    - **X.509 Certificate**: Enter your **X.509 Certificate**.

12. Click **Create**. Your Okta integration appears as an entry in **SSO Configuration**.
13. In **SSO Configuration**, click **Activate**. You are redirected to Okta to test your configuration. After you have successfully authenticated, you are redirected to Astro.
14. Click **Activate SSO**.

#### Step 2: Copy your SSO bypass link

:::caution

Do not share your single sign-on (SSO) bypass link. With an SSO bypass link, anyone with an email and a password can log in to Astro. Astronomer recommends periodically regenerating the link from the **Settings** tab in the Cloud UI.

:::

An SSO bypass link allows you to authenticate to your Organization without using SSO. This link should be used to access your Organization only when you can't access Astro due to an issue your identity provider.

1. In the Cloud UI, click the **Settings** tab.
   
2. In the **SSO Bypass Link** field, click **Copy**. Save this link for when you need to log in to Astro without using SSO.

If you don't want to maintain an SSO bypass link, click **Delete**. You can always regenerate a link if you need one in the future. 

#### Step 3: Assign users to your Okta application

On the page for your Okta app integration, open the **Assignments** tab. Ensure that all users who will use Astro are assigned to the integration. For more information, see [Assign applications to users](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/users-groups-profiles/usgp-assign-apps.htm).

## Advanced setup

### Disable just-in-time provisioning

Astro supports just-in-time provisioning by default for all single sign-on (SSO) integrations. This means that if someone without an Astronomer account tries logging into Astronomer with an email address from a domain that you manage, they are automatically granted a default role in your Organization without needing an invite. Users with emails outside of this domain need to be invited to your Organization to access it. 

Contact [Astronomer support](https://cloud.astronomer.io/support) for assistance with enabling or disabling just-in-time provisioning.

### Restrict authentication options 

By default, users can choose any of the [available authentication methods](#supported-sso-identity-providers) when logging into Astro. You can remove specific authentication options, such as GitHub or Google, so that users can use only the methods that your Organization wants to support, like your third party identity provider.

To restrict available authentication options on Astro for your organization, contact [Astronomer support](https://cloud.astronomer.io/support).

### Regenerate an SSO bypass link

Regenerating your SSO bypass link voids your existing SSO bypass link so that any former users with the existing link can't log in to Astro. 

1. In the Cloud UI, click the **Settings** tab.
   
2. Click **Regenerate** to create a new bypass link and void the old one.
