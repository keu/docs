As a Workspace Admin or Organization Owner, you can add new team members to Astro and grant them user roles with permissions for specific actions across your Organization. Workspace Admins can remove users from a Workspace, and Organization Owners can remove users from an Organization.

## Prerequisites

- To add or remove Organization users, you need Organization Owner permissions.
- To add or remove Workspace users, you need Workspace Admin permissions for that Workspace. The user must also already be a part of the Organization that hosts the Workspace.
- To remove a user from an Organization, one or more Organization Owners must be assigned to the Organization. If you're the only Organization Owner for your Organization, you'll need to assign another Organization Owner before removing yourself from the Organization.

For more information on user roles, see [Manage user permissions on Astro](user-permissions.md).

## Add a user to an Organization

You can invite a user to an Organization only if their email address' domain is in your Organization's allowlist. To add a domain to your Organization's allowlist, contact [Astronomer support](https://cloud.astronomer.io/support).

1. In the Cloud UI's Organization view, open the **People** tab.
