- Release date: April 30, 2023
- Airflow version: 2.6.0

:::warning Breaking change

Runtime 8 includes changes that can result in DAGs running differently after upgrading. It also includes a major bug that was subsequently fixed in Runtime 8.1. To use Airflow 2.6, Astronomer recommends upgrading directly to Runtime 8.1. See [Runtime upgrade considerations](upgrade-runtime.md#runtime-8-airflow-26) for more information.

:::

### Airflow 2.6

Astro Runtime 8 is based on Airflow 2.6, which includes a number of new features and improvements with an emphasis on observability. Most notably, Airflow 2.6 includes the following changes:

- [Notifiers](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/notifications.html) are a new class that can be used to send notifications from a DAG to a third party application, such as Slack. This release includes the [SlackNotifier](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-slack/stable/_api/airflow/providers/slack/notifications/slack_notifier/index.html#airflow.providers.slack.notifications.slack_notifier.SlackNotifier), with more notifiers coming in the future. 
- A major bug related to zombie tasks has been fixed. The logic for handling stalled tasks has been moved to the scheduler, and any tasks that have been queued for more than `scheduler.task_queued_timeout` are now marked as failed. This prevents a type of zombie task where tasks are stuck in an infinite loop of being scheduled and queued. 
- You can now view logs for individual triggers in the Airflow UI. Trigger logs tell you when an individual task is sleeping and when it's triggered.

To learn more, see the [Apache Airflow 2.6.0 release notes](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/release_notes.html#airflow-2-6-0-2023-04-30).

### Fewer dependencies installed by default

Astro Runtime now includes fewer default dependencies to save on memory usage. The following provider packages are no longer installed by default:

- `apache-airflow-providers-apache-hive`
- `apache-airflow-providers-apache-livy`
- `apache-airflow-providers-databricks`
- `apache-airflow-providers-dbt-cloud`
- `apache-airflow-providers-microsoft-mssql`
- `apache-airflow-providers-sftp`
- `apache-airflow-providers-snowflake`
- `apache-airflow-providers-ssh`

If your DAGs use any of these providers, ensure that the provider packages are listed in your Astro project `requirements.txt` file before upgrading. 

### Upgrade to Python 3.10

Astro Runtime now uses Python 3.10 by default. To continue using Python 3.9, see [Python versioning](runtime-image-architecture.md#python-versioning).

### Additional improvements

- Upgraded `astronomer-providers` to 1.15.4, which includes a bug fix for a backwards compatibility issue. See the [`astronomer-providers` changelog](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-providers/blob/main/CHANGELOG.rst#1154-2023-04-19) for a complete list of changes. 
- Upgraded `openlineage-airflow` to 0.23.0, which includes support for dbt snapshots and support for parsing additional SQL commands. See the [OpenLineage changelog](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0230---2023-4-20) for a complete list of changes.

## Astro Runtime 6.0.4

- Release date: November 14, 2022
- Airflow version: 2.4.3

### ARM64-based images for faster local development with Apple M1

:::caution

To deploy a project using Astro Runtime 6.0.4 or later from an Apple M1 computer to Astro, you must use Astro CLI version 1.4.0 or later or else the deploy will fail. See [Install the Astro CLI](cli/install-cli.md).

:::

Astro Runtime images now support both AMD64 and ARM64 processor architectures for local development. When you install Astro Runtime 6.0.4 or later, Docker automatically runs the correct architecture based on the computer you're using.

If you run the Astro CLI on a Mac computer that uses an ARM-based [Apple M1 Silicon chip](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/11/apple-unleashes-m1/), you will see a significant performance improvement when running Airflow locally. For example, the time it takes to run `astro dev start` on average has decreased from over 5 minutes to less than 2 minutes.

For more information on developing locally with the Astro CLI, see [Develop a Project](develop-project.md).

- A new **Grid** view in the Airflow UI that replaces the **Tree** view and provides a more intuitive way to visualize the state of your tasks.
- The ability to [define Airflow connections in JSON](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.3.0/howto/connection.html#json-format-example) instead of as a Connection URI.
- The ability to [reuse a decorated task function](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.3.0/tutorial_taskflow_api.html#reusing-a-decorated-task) between DAGs.

## Astro Runtime 4.0.7

- Release date: December 15, 2021
- Airflow version: 2.2.2

### Astronomer monitoring DAG

Astro Runtime 4.0.7 includes a monitoring DAG that is pre-installed in the Docker image and enabled for all customers. In addition to existing Deployment health and metrics functionality, this DAG allows the Astronomer team to better monitor the health of your data plane by enabling real-time visibility into whether your workers are healthy and tasks are running.

The `astronomer_monitoring_dag` runs a simple bash task every 5 minutes to ensure that your Airflow scheduler and workers are functioning as expected. If the task fails twice in a row or is not scheduled within a 10-minute interval, Astronomer support receives an alert and will work with you to troubleshoot.

Because this DAG is essential to Astro's managed service, your organization will not be charged for its task runs. For the same reasons, this DAG can't be modified or disabled via the Airflow UI. To modify how frequently this DAG runs, you can specify an alternate schedule as a cron expression by setting `AIRFLOW_MONITORING_DAG_SCHEDULE_INTERVAL` as an environment variable.

## Astro Runtime 4.0.0

- Release date: October 12, 2021
- Airflow version: 2.2.0

### Support for Airflow 2.2.0

Astro Runtime 4.0.0 is a significant release that supports and enhances [Apache Airflow 2.2.0](https://airflow.apache.org/blog/airflow-2.2.0/), an exciting milestone in the open source project. Most notably, this release introduces custom timetables and deferrable operators.

#### Custom timetables

Timetables represent a powerful new framework that allows Airflow users to create custom schedules using Python. In an effort to provide more flexibility and address known limitations imposed by cron, timetables use an intuitive `data_interval` that, for example, allows you to schedule a DAG to run daily on Monday through Friday, but not on the weekend. Timetables can be easily plugged into existing DAGs, which means that it's easy to create your own or use community-developed timetables in your project.

In addition to supporting the timetables framework, the team at Astronomer has built a `TradingHoursTimetable` that's ready to use in Runtime 4.0.0. You can use this timetable to run a DAG based on whether or not a particular global market is open for trade.

For more information on using timetables, read the [Apache Airflow Documentation](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/timetable.html).

#### Deferrable operators

[Deferrable operators](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/authoring-and-scheduling/deferring.html) are a new type of Airflow operator that promises improved performance and lower resource costs. While standard operators and sensors take up a worker slot even when they are waiting for an external trigger, deferrable operators are designed to suspend themselves and free up that worker slot while they wait. This is made possible by a new, lightweight Airflow component called the triggerer.

Existing Airflow operators have to be re-written according to the deferrable operator framework. In addition to supporting those available in the open source project, Astronomer has built an exclusive collection of deferrable operators in Runtime 4.0.0. This collection includes the `DatabricksSubmitRunOperator`, the `DatabricksRunNowOperator`, and the `ExternalTaskSensor`. These are designed to be drop-in replacements for corresponding operators currently in use.

As part of supporting deferrable operators, the triggerer is now available as a fully managed component on Astro. This means that you can start using deferrable operators in your DAGs as soon as you're ready. For more general information on deferrable operators, as well as how to use Astronomer's exclusive deferrable operators, read [Deferrable operators](https://docs.astronomer.io/learn/deferrable-operators).
