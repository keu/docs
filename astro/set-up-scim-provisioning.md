:::caution

This feature is in [Public Preview](https://docs.astronomer.io/astro/feature-previews).

:::

Astro supports integration with the open standard System for Cross-Domain Identity Management (SCIM). Using the SCIM protocol with Astro allows you to automatically provision and deprovision users and [Teams](manage-teams.md) based on templates for access and permissions. It also provides better observability through your identity provider for when users and Teams are created or modified across your organization. Specifically, you can utilize SCIM provisioning to complete the following Astro actions from your identity provider platform:

- Create and remove users in your Organization.
- Update user profile information.
- Create and remove Astro Teams.
- Add and remove Team members.
- Retrieve user and Team information.

:::info

Some user management features on Astro behave differently after you set up SCIM provisioning. See [Manage Teams](manage-teams.md#teams-and-scim-provisioning) for more information.

## Supported SSO identity providers

Astro supports SCIM provisioning with [Okta](https://www.okta.com/). You can configure SCIM provisioning on Okta both with and without using the official Astro Okta integration.

Support for [Azure Active Directory (AD)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/) is coming soon.

### Supported Okta features

Okta's Astro integration supports the following SCIM actions:

- Create users
- Update user attributes
- Deactivate users
- Group push

## Prerequisites

- A configured identity provider. See [Set up SSO](configure-idp.md).

## Frequently asked questions

### What if an Okta group is out of sync with an Astro Team?

1. In the Okta dashboard, open the Astro application and click **Push Groups**.
2. Click the value in **Push Status** for the group that's out of sync, then click **Push now**.

### What if an Okta user is out of sync with their Astro user account?

If you removed an Okta user but their Astro account remains, [delete the account from Astro](add-user.md#update-or-remove-an-organization-user).

If an Astro user is not appearing for an Okta user as expected, remove and re-assign the user in Okta.
