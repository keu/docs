Workspaces are collections of Deployments that can be accessed by a specific group of users. You can use Workspaces to group Deployments that share a business use case or environment trait. For example, you might create one Workspace that stores all of your production pipelines and another Workspace that stores all of your development pipelines.

## Create a Workspace

:::info

To create a Workspace, you must have an [Organization-level](user-permissions.md#organization-roles) role.

:::

To create a Workspace, click the **Add Workspace** button from the **Overview** tab.
