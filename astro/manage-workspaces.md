Workspaces are collections of Deployments that can be accessed by a specific group of users. You can use Workspaces to group Deployments that share a business use case or environment trait. For example, you might create one Workspace that stores all of your production pipelines and another Workspace that stores all of your development pipelines.

This document explains how to configure Workspace details. To manage Workspace users, see [Manage Astro users](add-user.md).

## Create a Workspace

:::info

To create a Workspace, you must have an [Organization-level](user-permissions.md#organization-roles) role.

To to enter your Workspace, click the Workspace in the **Overview** tab. When you click into a Workspace and see a list of that Workspace's Deployments, you are in the **Workspace view** of the Cloud UI. The Workspace view contains several pages for managing your Workspace which are accessible from a sidebar on the left of the screen:

- **Home**: View the status of your Deployments and select recently accessed Deployments. 
- **Deployments:** Create new Deployments and see key metrics about existing Deployments in the Workspace. For more information, see [Create a Deployment](create-deployment.md).
- **DAGs:** View metrics about individual DAGs across your Workspace. For more information, see [Deployment metrics](deployment-metrics.md#dag-runs).
- **Workspace Settings:** Update Workspace details, including Workspace user permissions, the Workspace name, and the Workspace description.
