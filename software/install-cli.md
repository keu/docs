## Overview

This guide provides instructions for how to install the Astro CLI.

The Astro CLI is the easiest way to run Apache Airflow on your machine. From the CLI, you can run a local Apache Airflow environment with a dedicated Webserver, Scheduler and Postgres Database. Once you create an Astronomer Software project, you can easily customize it (e.g. add Python or OS-level packages, plugins etc.) and test it on your local machine.

You can also use the CLI to:

- Authenticate to Astronomer Software.
- List the Astro Workspace and Deployments you have access to.
- Deploy a project to Software.

## Prerequisites

To install and use the Astro CLI on Mac, you must have:

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (v18.09 or higher).

To install and use the Astro CLI on Linux, you must have:

- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (v0.13.1 or higher).

#### Installation


1. Go to the [**Releases** page of the Astro CLI GitHub](https://github.com/astro-projects/astro-cli/releases). Based on your desired CLI version and CPU architecture, download one of the `.zip` files available on this page.

    For example, if you wanted to install v1.0.0 of the Astro CLI on a Windows Machine with an AMD 64 architecture, you would download `astro_1.0.0-converged_windows_amd64.zip`.

2. Run the following command to unzip the executable:

    ```sh
    tar -xvzf .\astrocli.tar.gz
    ```

3. Save `astro.exe` in a secure location on your machine and add its filepath in the Windows PATH environment variable. For more information about configuring the PATH environment variable, read [Java documentation](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html).
