description: Learn how to create a root user with all possible permissions on Astronomer Software. 
---

By default, the first user to log in to an Astronomer Software installation becomes a System Admin in that installation. If your organization has strong security requirements, you can create a single root user and give only this user permissions to create new System Admins on your installation. 

## Create the root user 

To create a root user, add the following lines to your `config.yaml` file:

```yaml
global:
	rootAdmin:
	    username: <your-root-user-email-address>
```

After saving your changes, apply the configuration change. See [Apply a config change](apply-platform-config.md).

By default, Astronomer generates a password for your root user email address. This password and email address are stored as Kubernetes secrets on your Astronomer installation. After you apply the configuration change, Helm provides a command for how to retrieve these the values of these secrets. 

## Rotate the root user's password

## Limit System-level user creation

A common use case for having a root user is to limit System-level user creation to only a single, tightly-controlled user. To configure your system this way, add the following lines to your `config.yaml` file:

```yaml
astronomer:
  houston:
    config:
      roles:
        SYSTEM_ADMIN:
          permissions:
            system.iam.updateSystemLevelPermissions: false
        SYSTEM_ROOT_ADMIN:
          permissions:
            system.iam.updateSystemLevelPermissions: true
```

After saving your changes, apply the configuration change. See [Apply a config change](apply-platform-config.md).

You can add or remove any permissions from your root user. See [Customize permissions](manage-platform-users.md#customize-permissions).
