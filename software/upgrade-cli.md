## Breaking Changes

This topic contains all information related to breaking changes included in Astro CLI vXX

Note that this topic does not include information about new non-breaking features and changes. For a summary of these changes, see the [CLI Release Notes](cli-release-notes.md).

### `astro dev init`: New `--use-astronomer-certified` Flag Required for All New Projects Deployed to Software

When you create a new Software project via `astro dev init`, you must now specify the `--use-astronomer-certified` flag if you want to [deploy the project](deploy-code.md) to a Software deployment. This flag initializes your project with the latest version of Astronomer Certified.

If you don't specify this flag, the project will be generated with an Astronomer Runtime image. You can run a project with a Runtime image locally, but you cannot deploy it to your Software installation.

```sh
# Before upgrade
astro dev init
# After upgrade
astro dev init --use-astronomer-certified
```

### `astro auth login/logout` Is Now `astro login/logout`

```sh
# Before upgrade
astro auth login <domain>
astro auth logout
# After upgrade
astro login <domain>
astro logout
```

When you specify properties for a Workspace using `astro workspace create/update`, you must now specify those properties with new flags.

```sh

astro workspace create label=my-workspace
# After upgrade
astro workspace create --label=my-workspace
```

### `astro workspace create/update`: `--desc` Flag Has Been Renamed to `--description`

The flag for specifying a description for a Workspace has been renamed from `--desc` to `--description`.

```

### `astro workspace user add`: User Email Is Now Specified as a Flag

You must now specify a new user's email using the `--email` flag when running `astro workspace `

```sh

astro workspace user add email-to-add@astronomer.io --role WORKSPACE_VIEWER
# After upgrade
astro workspace user add --email email-to-add@astronomer.io --role WORKSPACE_VIEWER
```

### `astro deploy` Now Accepts a Deployment ID Instead of a Release Name

```sh
# Before upgrade
astro deploy <release-name>
# After upgrade
astro deploy <deployment-id>
```

### `astro workspace sa get` Is Now `astro workspace sa list`

```sh
# Before upgrade

```

### `astro deployment/workspace sa create`: `--role` Only Accepts Full Role Names

The `--role` flag now accepts either `WORKSPACE_EDITOR`, `WORKSPACE_ADMIN`, or `WORKSPACE_VIEWER`.

```sh

```

### `astro deployment create/update` Now Takes All Properties as Flags

You must now specify a user's email using the `--email` flag when running `astro deployment user add`.

# After upgrade
astro deployment user add --email=<email> --deployment-id=<deployment-id>
```

### `astro deployment user delete` Is Now `astro deployment user remove`

```sh
# Before upgrade
astro deployment user delete <email> --deployment-id=<deployment-id>
# After upgrade
